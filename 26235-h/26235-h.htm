<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>ON THE TERRACE AT SHENSTONE</h3>
</div>

<p>Three o&#8217;clock on a dank afternoon, early
in November. The wintry sunshine, in
fitful gleams, pierced the greyness of the
leaden sky.</p>
<p>The great trees in Shenstone Park stood
gaunt and bare, spreading wide arms over the
sodden grass. All nature seemed waiting the
first fall of winter&#8217;s snow, which should hide
its deadness and decay under a lovely pall of
sparkling white, beneath which a promise of
fresh life to come might gently move and
stir; and, eventually, spring forth.</p>
<p>The Mistress of Shenstone moved slowly up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
and down the terrace, wrapped in her long
cloak, listening to the soft &#8220;drip, drip&#8221; of
autumn all around; noting the silent fall of the
last dead leaves; the steely grey of the lake
beyond; the empty flower-garden; the deserted
lawn.</p>
<p>The large stone house had a desolate
appearance, most of the rooms being, evidently,
closed; but, in one or two, cheerful
log-fires blazed, casting a ruddy glow upon
the window-panes, and sending forth a tempting
promise of warmth and cosiness within.</p>
<p>A tiny white toy-poodle walked the terrace
with his mistress&mdash;an agitated little bundle of
white curls; sometimes running round and
round her; then hurrying on before, or dropping
behind, only to rush on, in unexpected
haste, at the corners; almost tripping her up,
as she turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby, on one of these
occasions, &#8220;I do wish you would behave in a
more rational manner! Either come to heel
and follow sedately, as a dog of your age
should do; or trot on in front, in the gaily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
juvenile manner you assume when Michael
takes you out for a walk; but, for goodness
sake, don&#8217;t be so fidgety; and don&#8217;t run round
and round me in this bewildering way, or I
shall call for William, and send you in. I
only wish Michael could see you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The little animal looked up at her,
pathetically, through his tumbled curls&mdash;a
soft silky mass, which had earned for him his
name of Shockheaded Peter. His eyes, red-rimmed
from the cold wind, had that unseeing
look, often noticeable in a very old
dog. Yet there was in them, and in the whole
pose of his tiny body, an anguish of anxiety,
which could not have escaped a genuine dog-lover.
Even Lady Ingleby became partially
aware of it. She stooped and patted his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little Peter,&#8221; she said, more kindly.
&#8220;It is horrid, for us both, having Michael so
far away at this tiresome war. But he will
come home before long; and we shall forget all
the anxiety and loneliness. It will be spring
again. Michael will have you properly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
clipped, and we will go to Brighton, where
you enjoy trotting about, and hearing people
call you &#8216;The British Lion.&#8217; I verily believe
you consider yourself the size of the lions in
Trafalgar Square! I cannot imagine why a
great big man, such as Michael, is so devoted
to a tiny scrap of a dog, such as you! Now,
if you were a Great Dane, or a mighty St.
Bernard&mdash;! However, Michael loves us both,
and we both love Michael; so we must be
nice to each other, little Peter, while he is
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra Ingleby smiled, drew the folds of
her cloak more closely around her, and moved
on. A small white shadow, with no wag to
its tail, followed dejectedly behind.</p>
<p>And the dead leaves, loosing their hold of
the sapless branches, fluttered to the sodden
turf; and the soft &#8220;drip, drip&#8221; of autumn fell
all around.</p>
<p>The door of the lower hall opened. A
footman, bringing a telegram, came quickly
out. His features were set, in well-trained
impassivity; but his eyelids flickered nervously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
as he handed the silver salver to his
mistress.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby&#8217;s lovely face paled to absolute
whiteness beneath her large beaver hat;
but she took up the orange envelope with
a steady hand, opening it with fingers which
did not tremble. As she glanced at the
signature, the colour came back to her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Dr. Brand,&#8221; she said, with an
involuntary exclamation of relief; and the
waiting footman turned and nodded furtively
toward the house. A maid, at a window,
dropped the blind, and ran to tell the anxious
household all was well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lady Ingleby read her telegram.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Visiting patient in your neighbourhood. Can
you put me up for the night? Arriving 4.30.</p>
<p>Deryck Brand.</p>
</div>
<p>Lady Ingleby turned to the footman.
&#8220;William,&#8221; she said, &#8220;tell Mrs. Jarvis, Sir
Deryck Brand is called to this neighbourhood,
and will stay here to-night. They can light
a fire at once in the magnolia room, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
prepare it for him. He will be here in an
hour. Send the motor to the station. Tell
Groatley we will have tea in my sitting-room
as soon as Sir Deryck arrives. Send down
word to the Lodge to Mrs. O&#8217;Mara, that I
shall want her up here this evening. Oh,
and&mdash;by the way&mdash;mention at once at the
Lodge that there is no further news from
abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, m&#8217; lady,&#8221; said the footman; and
Myra Ingleby smiled at the reflection, in the
lad&#8217;s voice and face, of her own immense
relief. He turned and hastened to the house;
Peter, in a sudden access of misplaced energy,
barking furiously at his heels.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby moved to the front of the
terrace and stood beside one of the stone
lions, close to an empty vase, which in summer
had been a brilliant mass of scarlet geraniums.
Her face was glad with expectation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody to talk to, at last!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I had begun to think I should have to brave
dear mamma, and return to town. And
Sir Deryck of all people! He wires from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
Victoria, so I conclude he sees his patient
<i>en route</i>, or in the morning. How perfectly
charming of him to give me a whole evening.
I wonder how many people would, if they
knew of it, be breaking the tenth commandment
concerning me! ... Peter, you little
fiend! Come here! Why the footmen, and
gardeners, and postmen, do not kick out
your few remaining teeth, passes me! You
pretend to be too unwell to eat your dinner,
and then behave like a frantic hyena, because
poor innocent William brings me a telegram!
I shall write and ask Michael if I may have
you hanged.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, in high good humour, Lady Ingleby
went into the house.</p>
<p>But, outside, the dead leaves turned slowly,
and rustled on the grass; while the soft &#8220;drip,
drip&#8221; of autumn fell all around. The dying
year was almost dead; and nature waited for
her pall of snow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE FORERUNNER</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What it is to have somebody to talk to,
at last! And <i>you</i>, of all people, dear
Doctor! Though I still fail to understand how
a patient, who has brought you down to these
parts, can wait for your visit until to-morrow
morning, thus giving a perfectly healthy
person, such as myself, the inestimable
privilege of your company at tea, dinner,
and breakfast, with delightful <i>tête-à-têtes</i> in
between. All the world knows your minutes
are golden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus Lady Ingleby, as she poured out the
doctor&#8217;s tea, and handed it to him.</p>
<p>Deryck Brand placed the cup carefully on
his corner of the folding tea-table, helped
himself to thin bread-and-butter; then answered,
with his most charming smile,</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine would be a very dismal profession
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
dear lady, if it precluded me from ever having
a meal, or a conversation, or from spending a
pleasant evening, with a perfectly healthy
person. I find the surest way to live one&#8217;s
life to the full, accomplishing the maximum
amount of work with the minimum amount of
strain, is to cultivate the habit of living in the
present; giving the whole mind to the scene,
the subject, the person, of the moment.
Therefore, with your leave, we will dismiss
my patients, past and future; and enjoy, to
the full, this unexpected <i>tête-à-tête</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra Ingleby looked at her visitor. His
forty-two years sat lightly on him, notwithstanding
the streaks of silver in the dark
hair just over each temple. There was a
youthful alertness about the tall athletic figure;
but the lean brown face, clean shaven and
reposeful, held a look of quiet strength and
power, mingled with a keen kindliness and ready
comprehension, which inspired trust, and drew
forth confidence.</p>
<p>The burden of a great loneliness seemed
lifted from Myra&#8217;s heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you always put so much salt on your
bread-and-butter?&#8221; she said. &#8220;And how
glad I am to be &#8216;the person of the moment.&#8217;
Only&mdash;until this mysterious &#8216;patient in the
neighbourhood&#8217; demands your attention,&mdash;you
ought to be having a complete holiday,
and I must try to forget that I am talking to
the greatest nerve specialist of the day, and
only realise the pleasure of entertaining so
good a friend of Michael&#8217;s and my own.
Otherwise I should be tempted to consult you;
for I really believe, Sir Deryck, for the first
time in my life, I am becoming neurotic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor did not need to look at his
hostess. His practised eye had already noted
the thin cheeks; the haunted look; the purple
shadows beneath the lovely grey eyes, for
which the dark fringes of black eyelashes were
not altogether accountable. He leaned forward
and looked into the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;If such is really the case,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that
you should be aware of it, is so excellent
a symptom, that the condition cannot be
serious. But I want you to remember,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
Lady Ingleby, that I count all my patients,
friends; also that my friends may consider
themselves at liberty, at any moment, to
become my patients. So consult me, if I
can be of any use to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor helped himself to more bread-and-butter,
folding it with careful precision.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby held out her hand for his
cup, grateful that he did not appear to notice
the rush of unexpected tears to her eyes.
She busied herself with the urn until she could
control her voice; then said, with a rather
tremulous laugh: &#8220;Ah, thank you! Presently&mdash;if
I may&mdash;I gladly will consult you. Meanwhile,
how do you like &#8216;the scene of the
moment&#8217;? Do you consider my boudoir
improved? Michael made all these alterations
before he went away. The new electric
lights are a patent arrangement of his own.
And had you seen his portrait? A wonderful
likeness, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor looked around him, appreciatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been admiring the room, ever since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
I entered,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is charming.&#8221;
Then he raised his eyes to the picture over
the mantelpiece:&mdash;the life-sized portrait of a
tall, bearded man, with the high brow of the
scholar and thinker; the eyes of the mystic;
the gentle unruffled expression of the saint.
He appeared old enough to be the father of
the woman in whose boudoir his portrait
was the central object. The artist had
painted him in an old Norfolk shooting-suit,
leather leggings, hunting-crop in hand, seated
in a garden chair, beside a rustic table.
Everything in the picture was homely, old,
and comfortable; the creases in the suit were
old friends; the ancient tobacco pouch on the
table was worn and stained. Russet-brown
predominated, and the highest light in the
painting was the clear blue of those dreamy,
musing eyes. They were bent upon the
table, where sat, in an expectant attitude of
adoring attention, a white toy-poodle. The
palpable devotion between the big man and
the tiny dog, the concentrated affection with
which they looked at one another, were very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
cleverly depicted. The picture might have
been called: &#8220;We two&#8221;; also it left an impression
of a friendship in which there had
been no room for a third. The doctor glanced,
for an instant, at the lovely woman on the
lounge, behind the silver urn, and his
subconsciousness propounded the question:
&#8220;Where did <i>she</i> come in?&#8221; But the next
moment he turned towards the large armchair
on his right, where a small dejected mass of
white curls lay in a huddled heap. It was
impossible to distinguish between head and
tail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the little dog?&#8221; asked the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; that is Peter. But in the picture
he is smart and properly clipped, and feeling
better than he does just now. Peter and
Michael are devoted to each other; and, when
Michael is away, Peter is left in my charge.
But I am not fond of small dogs; and I really
consider Peter very much spoilt. Also I
always feel he just tolerates me because I am
Michael&#8217;s wife, and remains with me because,
where I am, there Michael will return. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
I am quite kind to him, for Michael&#8217;s sake.
Only he really is a nasty little dog; and too
old to be allowed to continue. Michael
always speaks of him as if he were quite too
good to live; and, personally, I think it is
high time he went where all good dogs go.
I cannot imagine what is the matter with
him now. Since yesterday afternoon he has
refused all his food, and been so restless
and fidgety. He always sleeps on Michael&#8217;s
bed; and, as a rule, after I have put him
there, and closed the door between Michael&#8217;s
room and mine, I hear no more of Peter, until
he barks to be let out in the morning, and my
maid takes him down-stairs. But last night,
he whined and howled for hours. At length
I got up, found Michael&#8217;s old shooting jacket&mdash;the
very one in the portrait&mdash;and laid it on the
bed. Peter crawled into it, and cuddled
down, I folded the sleeves around him, and
he seemed content. But to-day he still
refuses to eat. I believe he is dyspeptic, or
has some other complaint, such as dogs develop
when they are old. Honestly&mdash;don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
you think&mdash;a little effective poison, in an
attractive pill&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush!&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;Peter may
not be asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby laughed. &#8220;My dear Sir
Deryck! Do you suppose animals understand
our conversation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I do,&#8221; replied the doctor. &#8220;And
more than that, they do not require the
medium of language. Their comprehension
is telepathic. They read our thoughts. A
nervous rider or driver can terrify a horse.
Dumb creatures will turn away from those
who think of them with dislike or aversion;
whereas a true lover of animals can win them
without a spoken word. The thought of love
and of goodwill reaches them telepathically,
winning instant trust and response. Also, if
we take the trouble to do so, we can, to a great
extent, arrive at their ideas, in the same
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Extraordinary!&#8221; exclaimed Lady Ingleby.
&#8220;Well, I wish you would thought-read
what is the matter with Peter. I shall not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
know how to face Michael&#8217;s home-coming,
if anything goes wrong with his belovèd
dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor lay back in his armchair; crossed
his knees the one over the other; rested his
elbows on the arms of the chair; then let his
finger-tips meet very exactly. Instinctively
he assumed the attitude in which he usually
sat when bending his mind intently on a
patient. Presently he turned and looked
steadily at the little white heap curled up in
the big armchair.</p>
<p>The room was very still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter!&#8221; said the doctor, suddenly.</p>
<p>Peter sat up at once, and peeped at the
doctor, through his curls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little Peter,&#8221; said the doctor, kindly.</p>
<p>Peter moved to the edge of the chair; sat
very upright, and looked eagerly across to
where the doctor was sitting. Then he
wagged his tail, tapping the chair with
quick, anxious, little taps.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first wag I have seen in twenty-four
hours,&#8221; remarked Lady Ingleby; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
neither Deryck Brand nor Shockheaded Peter
heeded the remark.</p>
<p>The anxious eyes of the dog were gazing,
with an agony of question, into the kind keen
eyes of the man.</p>
<p>Without moving, the doctor spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Yes</i>, little Peter,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Peter&#8217;s small tufted tail ceased thumping.
He sat very still for a moment; then quietly
moved back to the middle of the chair, turned
round and round three or four times; then lay
down, dropping his head between his paws
with one long shuddering sigh, like a little
child which has sobbed itself to sleep.</p>
<p>The doctor turned, and looked at Lady
Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; queried Myra,
astonished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Peter asked a question,&#8221; replied
Sir Deryck, gravely; &#8220;and I answered it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful! Will you talk this telepathy
over with Michael when he comes home?
It would interest him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor looked into the fire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is a big subject,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I
can spare the time, I am thinking of writing
an essay on the mental and spiritual development
of animals, as revealed in the Bible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Balaam&#8217;s ass?&#8221; suggested Lady Ingleby,
promptly.</p>
<p>The doctor smiled. &#8220;Quite so,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But Balaam&#8217;s ass is neither the only animal
in the Bible, nor the most interesting case.
Have you ever noticed the many instances
in which animals immediately obeyed God&#8217;s
commands, even when those commands ran
counter to their strongest instincts? For
instance:&mdash;the lion, who met the disobedient
man of God on the road from Bethel. The
instinct of the beast, after slaying the man,
would have been to maul the body, drag it
away into his lair, and devour it. But the
Divine command was:&mdash;that he should slay,
but not eat the carcass, nor tear the ass.
The instinct of the ass would have been to
flee in terror from the lion; but, undoubtedly,
a Divine assurance overcame her natural
fear; and all men who passed by beheld this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
remarkable sight:&mdash;a lion and an ass standing
sentry, one on either side of the dead body of
the man of God; and there they remained
until the old prophet from Bethel arrived, to
fetch away the body and bury it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Extraordinary!&#8221; said Lady Ingleby. &#8220;So
they did. And now one comes to think of it
there are plenty of similar instances. The
instinct of the serpent which Moses lifted up
on a pole, would have been to come scriggling
down, and go about biting the Israelites, instead
of staying up on the pole, to be looked
at for their healing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor smiled. &#8220;Quite so,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;Only, we must not quote him as an instance;
because, being made of brass, I fear he was
devoid of instinct. Otherwise he would have
been an excellent case in point. And I
believe animals possess far more spiritual
life than we suspect. Do you remember a
passage in the Psalms which says that the
lions &#8216;seek their meat from God&#8217;? And, more
striking still, in the same Psalm we read of the
whole brute creation, that when God hides
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
His face &#8216;they are troubled.&#8217; Good heavens!&#8221;
said the doctor, earnestly; &#8220;I wish <i>our</i> spiritual
life always answered to these two tests:&mdash;that
God&#8217;s will should be paramount over our
strongest instincts; and that any cloud between
us and the light of His face, should
cause us instant trouble of soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like that expression &#8216;spiritual life,&#8217;&#8221;
said Lady Ingleby. &#8220;I am sure you mean
by it what other people sometimes express
so differently. Did you hear of the Duchess
of Meldrum attending that big evangelistic
meeting in the Albert Hall? I really don&#8217;t
know exactly what it was. Some sort of
non-sectarian mission, I gather, with a preacher
over from America; and the meetings went on
for a fortnight. It would never have occurred
to me to go to them. But the dear old
duchess always likes to be &#8216;in the know&#8217; and
to sample everything. Besides, she holds a
proprietary stall. So she sailed into the
Albert Hall one afternoon, in excellent time,
and remained throughout the entire proceedings.
She enjoyed the singing; thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
the vast listening crowd, marvellous; was
moved to tears by the eloquence of the
preacher, and was leaving the hall more
touched than she had been for years, and
fully intending to return, bringing others with
her, when a smug person, hovering about
the entrance, accosted her with: &#8216;Excuse me
madam; are you a Christian?&#8217; The duchess
raised her lorgnette in blank amazement, and
looked him tip and down. Very likely the
tears still glistened upon her proud old face.
Anyway this impossible person appears to have
considered her a promising case. Emboldened
by her silence, he laid his hand upon her arm,
and repeated his question: &#8216;Madam, are you
a Christian?&#8217; Then the duchess awoke to the
situation with a vengeance. &#8216;My good man,&#8217;
she said, clearly and deliberately, so that all
in the lobby could hear; &#8216;I should have thought
it would have been perfectly patent to your
finely trained perceptions, that I am an
engaging mixture of Jew, Turk, Infidel, and
Heathen Chinee! Now, if you will kindly
stand aside, I will pass to my carriage.&#8217;&mdash;And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
the duchess sampled no more evangelistic
meetings!&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor sighed. &#8220;Tactless,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Ah, the pity of it, when &#8216;fools rush in where
angels fear to tread!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People scream with laughter, when the
duchess tells it,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby; &#8220;but then
she imitates the unctuous person so exactly;
and she does not mention the tears. I have
them from an eye-witness. But&mdash;as I was
saying&mdash;I like your expression: &#8216;spiritual
life.&#8217; It really holds a meaning; and, though
one may have to admit one does not possess
any, or, that what one does possess is at a
low ebb, yet one sees the genuine thing in
others, and it is something to believe in, at all
events.&mdash;Look how peacefully little Peter is
sleeping. You have evidently set his mind
at rest. That is Michael&#8217;s armchair; and,
therefore, Peter&#8217;s. Now we will send away
the tea-things; and then&mdash;may I become a
patient?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>WHAT PETER KNEW</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t my good Groatley a curious looking
person?&#8221; said Lady Ingleby, as the door
closed behind the butler. &#8220;I call him the
Gryphon, because he looks perpetually astonished.
His eyebrows are like black horseshoes,
and they mount higher and higher up
his forehead as one&#8217;s sentence proceeds. But
he is very faithful, and knows his work, and
Michael approves him. Do you like this
portrait of Michael? Garth Dalmain stayed
here a few months before he lost his sight,
poor boy, and painted us both. I believe
mine was practically his last portrait. It
hangs in the dining-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor moved his chair opposite the
fireplace, so that he could sit facing the
picture over the mantelpiece, yet turn readily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
toward Lady Ingleby on his left. On his
right, little Peter, with an occasional sobbing
sigh, slept heavily in his absent master&#8217;s chair.
The log-fire burned brightly. The electric
light, from behind amber glass, sent a golden
glow as of sunshine through the room. The
dank damp drip of autumn had no place in
this warm luxury. The curtains were closely
drawn; and that which is not seen, can be
forgotten.</p>
<p>The doctor glanced at the clock. The
minute-hand pointed to the quarter before
six.</p>
<p>He lifted his eyes to the picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know Lord Ingleby sufficiently
well to give an opinion; but I should say it is
an excellent likeness, possessing, to a large
degree, the peculiar quality of all Dalmain&#8217;s
portraits:&mdash;the more you look at them, the
more you see in them. They are such extraordinary
character studies. With your
increased knowledge of the person, grows
your appreciation of the cleverness of the
portrait.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby, leaning forward
to look intently up at the picture. &#8220;It often
startles me as I come into the room, because I
see a fresh expression on the face, just according
to my own mood, or what I happen to have
been doing; and I realise Michael&#8217;s mind on
the subject more readily from the portrait
than from my own knowledge of him. Garth
Dalmain was a genius!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now tell me,&#8221; said the doctor, gently.
&#8220;Why did you leave town, your many friends,
your interests there, in order to bury yourself
down here, during this dismal autumn weather?
Surely the strain of waiting for news would
have been less, within such easy reach of the
War Office and of the evening papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby laughed, rather mirthlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came away, Sir Deryck, partly to escape
from dear mamma; and as you do not know
dear mamma, it is almost impossible for you
to understand how essential it was to escape.
When Michael is away, I am defenceless.
Mamma swoops down; takes up her abode in
my house; reduces my household, according
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
to their sex and temperament, to rage, hysterics,
or despair; tells unpalatable home-truths
to my friends, so that all&mdash;save the duchess&mdash;flee
discomforted. Then mamma proceeds
to &#8216;divide the spoil&#8217;! In other words: she
lies in wait for my telegrams, and opens them
herself, saying that if they contain <i>good</i>
news, a dutiful daughter should delight in at
once sharing it with her; whereas, if they contain
<i>bad</i> news, which heaven forbid!&mdash;and
surely, with mamma snorting skyward, heaven
would not venture to do otherwise!&mdash;<i>she</i>
is the right person to break it to me,
gently. I bore it for six weeks; then fled down
here, well knowing that not even the dear
delight of bullying me would bring mamma to
Shenstone in autumn.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor&#8217;s face was grave. For a moment
he looked silently into the fire. He was
a man of many ideals, and foremost among
them was his ideal of the relation which should
be between parents and children; of the loyalty
to a mother, which, even if forced to admit
faults or failings, should tenderly shield them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
from the knowledge or criticism of outsiders.
It hurt him, as a sacrilege, to hear a daughter
speak thus of her mother; yet he knew well,
from facts which were common knowledge,
how little cause the sweet, lovable woman at
his side had to consider the tie either a sacred
or a tender one. He had come to help, not
to find fault. Also, the minute-hand was
hastening towards the hour; and the final
instructions of the kind-hearted old Duchess
of Meldrum, as she parted from him at the
War Office, had been: &#8220;Remember! Six
o&#8217;clock from London. I shall <i>insist</i> upon its
being kept back until then. If they make
difficulties, I shall camp in the entrance and
&#8216;hold up&#8217; every messenger who attempts to
pass out. But I am accustomed to have my
own way with these good people. I should
not hesitate to ring up Buckingham Palace,
if necessary, as they very well know! So
you may rest assured it will not leave London
until six o&#8217;clock. It gives you ample time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore the doctor said: &#8220;I understand.
It does not come within my own experience;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
yet I think I understand. But tell me,
Lady Ingleby. If bad news were to come,
would you sooner receive it direct from the
War Office, in the terribly crude wording
which cannot be avoided in those telegrams;
or would you rather that a friend&mdash;other than
your mother&mdash;broke it to you, more gently?&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra&#8217;s eyes flashed. She sat up with
instant animation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I would receive it direct,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;It would be far less hard, if it were official.
I should hear the roll of the drums, and see
the wave of the flag. For England, and for
Honour! A soldier&#8217;s daughter, and a soldier&#8217;s
wife, should be able to stand up to anything.
If they had to tell me Michael was in great
danger, I should share his danger in receiving
the news without flinching. If he were
wounded, as I read the telegram I should
receive a wound myself, and try to be as brave
as he. All which came direct from the war,
would unite me to Michael. But interfering
friends, however well-meaning, would come
between. If <i>he</i> had not been shielded from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
a bullet or a sword-thrust, why should <i>I</i> be
shielded from the knowledge of his wound?&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor screened his face with his hand,</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The clock struck six.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that was not the only reason I left
town,&#8221; continued Lady Ingleby, with evident
effort. Then she flung out both hands towards
him. &#8220;Oh, doctor! I wonder if I might tell
you a thing which has been a burden on my
heart and life for years!&#8221;</p>
<p>There followed a tense moment of silence;
but the doctor was used to such moments, and
could usually determine during the silence,
whether the confidence should be allowed or
avoided. He turned and looked steadily at
the lovely wistful face.</p>
<p>It was the face of an exceedingly beautiful
woman, nearing thirty. But the lovely eyes
still held the clear candour of the eyes of a
little child, the sweet lips quivered with
quickly felt emotion, the low brow showed
no trace of shame or sin. The doctor knew
he was in the presence of one of the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
popular hostesses, one of the most admired
women, in the kingdom. Yet his keen professional
insight revealed to him an arrested
development; possibilities unfulfilled; a problem
of inadequacy and consequent disappointment,
to which he had not the key.
But those outstretched hands eagerly held it
towards him. Could he bring help, if he
accepted a knowledge of the solution; or&mdash;did
help come too late?</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Lady Ingleby,&#8221; he said, quietly;
&#8220;tell me anything you like; that is to say,
anything which you feel assured Lord Ingleby
would allow discussed with a third person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra leaned back among the cushions and
laughed&mdash;a gay little laugh, half of amusement,
half of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Michael would not mind!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Anything Michael would mind, I have
always told straight to himself; and they were
silly little things; such as foolish people trying
to make love to me; or a foreign prince, with
moustaches like the German Emperor&#8217;s, offering
to shoot Michael, if I would promise to marry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
him when his period of consequent imprisonment
was over. I cut the idiots who had
presumed to make love to me, ever after; and
assured the foreign prince, I should undoubtedly
kill him myself, if he hurt a hair of
Michael&#8217;s head! No, dear doctor. My life
is clear of all that sort of complication. My
trouble is a harder one, involving one&#8217;s whole
life-problem. And that problem is incompetence
and inadequacy&mdash;not towards the world,
I should not care a rap for that; but towards
the one to whom I owe most: towards Michael,&mdash;my
husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor moved uneasily in his chair, and
glanced at the clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; cried Myra. &#8220;You must not stop
me. Let me at last have the relief of speech!
My friend, I am twenty-eight; I have had ten
years of married life; yet I do not believe I
have ever really grown up! In heart and
brain I am an undeveloped child, and I know
it; and, worse still, Michael knows it, and&mdash;<i>Michael
does not mind</i>. Listen! It dates back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
to years ago. Mamma never allowed any of
her daughters to grow up. We were permitted
no individuality of our own, no opinions, no
independence. All that was required of us,
was to &#8216;do her behests, and follow in her
train.&#8217; Forgive the misquotation. We were
always children in mamma&#8217;s eyes. We grew
tall; we grew good-looking; but we never
grew up. We remained children, to be
snubbed, domineered over, and bullied. My
sisters, who were good children, had plenty
of jam and cake; and, eventually, husbands
after mamma&#8217;s own heart were found for
them. Perhaps you know how those marriages
have turned out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby paused, and the doctor made
an almost imperceptible sign of assent. One
of the ladies in question, a most unhappy
woman, was under treatment in his Mental
Sanatorium at that very moment; but he
doubted whether Lady Ingleby knew it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the black sheep,&#8221; continued Myra,
finding no remark forthcoming. &#8220;Nothing I
did was ever right; everything I did was always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
wrong. When Michael met me I was nearly
eighteen, the height I am now, but in the
nursery, as regards mental development or
knowledge of the world; and, as regards
character, a most unhappy, utterly reckless,
little child. Michael&#8217;s love, when at last I
realised it, was wonderful to me. Tenderness,
appreciation, consideration, were experiences
so novel that they would have turned my
head, had not the elation they produced been
counterbalanced by a gratitude which was
overwhelming; and a terror of being handed
back to mamma, which would have made me
agree to anything. Years later, Michael told
me that what first attracted him to me was
a look in my eyes just like the look in those of
a favourite spaniel of his, who was always in
trouble with everyone else, and had just been
accidentally shot, by a keeper. Michael told
me this himself; and really thought I should
be pleased! Somehow it gave me the key to
my standing with him&mdash;just that of a very
tenderly-loved pet dog. No words can say
how good he has always been to me. If I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
lost him, I should lose my all&mdash;everything
which makes home, home; and life a safe, and
certain, thing. But if <i>he</i> lost little Peter, it
would be a more real loss to him than if
he lost me; because Peter is more intelligent
for his size, and really more of an actual
companion to Michael, than I am. Many
a time, when he has passed through my room
on the way to his, with Peter tucked securely
under his arm; and saying, &#8216;Good-night, my
dear,&#8217; to me, has gone in and shut the door,
I have felt I could slay little Peter, because he
had the better place, and because he looked at
me through his curls, as he was carried away,
as if to say: &#8216;<i>You</i> are out of it!&#8217; Yet I knew
I had all I deserved; and Michael&#8217;s kindness
and goodness and patience were beyond
words. Only&mdash;only&mdash;ah, <i>can</i> you understand?
I would sooner he had found fault
and scolded; I would sooner have been shaken
and called a fool, than smiled at, and left
alone. I was in the nursery when he married
me; I have been in the school-room ever since,
trying to learn life&#8217;s lessons, alone, without a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
teacher. Nothing has helped me to grow up.
Michael has always told me I am perfect, and
everything I do is perfect, and he does not
want me different. But I have never really
shared his life and interests. If I make
idiotic mistakes he does not correct me.
I have to find them out, when I repeat them
before others. When I made that silly
blunder about the brazen serpent, you so
kindly put me right. Michael would have
smiled and let it pass as not worth correcting;
then I should have repeated it before a roomful
of people, and wondered why they looked
amused! Ah, but what do I care for people, or
the world! It is my true place beside Michael
I want to win. I want to &#8216;grow up unto him
in all things.&#8217; Yes, I know that is a text. I
am famous for misquotations, or rather, misapplications.
But it expresses my meaning&mdash;as
the duchess remarks, when <i>she</i> has said
something mild under provocation, and her
parrot swears!&mdash;And now tell me, dear wise
kind doctor; you, who have been the lifelong
friend of that grand creature, Jane Dalmain;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
you, who have done so much for dozens of
women I know; tell me how I can cease to be
inadequate towards my husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>The passionate flow of words ceased suddenly.
Lady Ingleby leaned back against the
cushions.</p>
<p>Peter sighed in his sleep.</p>
<p>A clock in the hall chimed the quarter
after six.</p>
<p>The doctor looked steadily into the fire.
He seemed to find speech difficult.</p>
<p>At last he said, in a voice which shook
slightly: &#8220;Dear Lady Ingleby, he did not&mdash;he
does not&mdash;think you so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she cried, sitting forward again.
&#8220;He thinks of me nothing but what is kind and
right. But he never expected me to be more
than a nice, affectionate, good-looking dog;
and I&mdash;I have not known how to be better
than his expectations. But, although he is
so patient, he sometimes grows unutterably
tired of being with me. All other pet creatures
are dumb; but I love talking, and I constantly
say silly things, which do not <i>sound</i> silly, until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
I have said them. He goes off to Norway,
fishing; to the Engadine, mountain-climbing;
to this horrid war, risking his precious life.
Anywhere to get away alone; anywhere
to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; said the doctor, and laid a firm
brown hand, for a moment, on the white
fluttering fingers. &#8220;You are overwrought by
the suspense of these past weeks. You know
perfectly well that Lord Ingleby volunteered
for this border war because he was so keen on
experimenting with his new explosives, and on
trying these ideas for using electricity in
modern warfare, at which he has worked so
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I know,&#8221; said Myra, smiling wistfully.
&#8220;Tiresome things, which keep him
hours in his laboratory. And he has some
very clever plan for long distance signalling
from fort to fort&mdash;hieroglyphics in the sky,
isn&#8217;t it? you know what I mean. But the
fact that he volunteered into all this danger,
merely to do experimenting, makes it harder
to bear than if he had been at the head of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
old regiment, and gone at the imperative call
of duty. However&mdash;nothing matters so long
as he comes home safely. And now you&mdash;you,
Sir Deryck&mdash;must help me to become a real
helpmeet to Michael. Tell me how you
helped&mdash;oh, very well, we will not mention
names. But give me wise advice. Give me
hope; give me courage. Make me strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor looked at the clock; and, even
as he looked, the chimes in the hall rang out
the half-hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not yet told me,&#8221; he said,
speaking very slowly, as if listening for some
other sound; &#8220;you have not yet told me, your
second reason for leaving town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby, and her voice
held a deeper, older, tone&mdash;a note bordering
on tragedy. &#8220;Ah! I left town, Sir Deryck,
because other people were teaching me love-lessons,
and I did not want to learn them
apart from Michael. I stayed with Jane
Dalmain and her blind husband, before they
went back to Gleneesh. You remember?
They were in town for the production of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
symphony. I saw that ideal wedded life,
and I realised something of what a perfect
mating of souls could mean. And then&mdash;well,
there were others; people who did not
understand how wholly I am Michael&#8217;s;
nothing actually wrong; but not so fresh and
youthful as Billy&#8217;s innocent adoration; and I
feared I should accidentally learn what only
Michael must teach. Therefore I fled away!
Oh, doctor; if I ever learned from another
man, that which I have failed to learn from
my own husband, I should lie at Michael&#8217;s
feet and implore him to kill me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor looked up at the portrait over
the mantelpiece. The calm passionless face
smiled blandly at the tiny dog. One sensitive
hand, white and delicate as a woman&#8217;s, was
raised, forefinger uplifted, gently holding the
attention of the little animal&#8217;s eager eyes.
The magic skill of the artist supplied the
doctor with the key to the problem. A
<i>woman</i>&mdash;as mate, as wife, as part of himself,
was not a necessity in the life of this thinker,
inventor, scholar, saint. He could appreciate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
dumb devotion; he was capable of unlimited
kindness, leniency, patience, toleration. But
woman and dog alike, remained outside the
citadel of his inner self. Had not her eyes resembled
those of a favourite spaniel, he would
very probably not have wedded the lovely
woman who, now, during ten years had borne
his name; and even then he might not have
done so, had not the tyranny of her mother,
awakening his instinct of protection towards
the weak and oppressed, aroused in him a
determination to withstand that tyranny, and
to carry her off triumphantly to freedom.</p>
<p>The longer the doctor looked, the more
persistently the picture said; &#8220;We two; and
where does <i>she</i> come in?&#8221;&mdash;Righteous wrath
arose in the heart of Deryck Brand; for his
ideal as to man&#8217;s worship of woman was a
high one. As he thought of the closed door;
of the lonely wife, humbly jealous of a toy-poodle,
yet blaming herself only, for her loneliness,
his jaw set, and his brow darkened.
And all the while he listened for a sound from
the outer world which must soon come.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>Lady Ingleby noticed his intent gaze, and,
leaning forward, also looked up at the picture.
The firelight shone on her lovely face, and on
the gleaming softness of her hair. Her lips
parted in a tender smile; a pure radiance shone
from her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, he <i>is</i> so good!&#8221; she said. &#8220;In all the
years, he has never once spoken harshly to
me. And see how lovingly he looks at Peter,
who really is a most unattractive little dog.
Did you ever hear the duchess&#8217;s <i>bon mot</i>
about Michael? He and I once stayed together
at Overdene; but she did not ask us
again until he was abroad, fishing in Norway;
so of course I went by myself. The duchess
always does those things frankly, and explains
them. Therefore on this occasion she said:
&#8216;My dear, I enjoy a visit from you; but you
must only come, when you can come alone.
I will never undertake again, to live up to
your good Michael. It really was a case of
St. Michael and All Angels. <i>He</i> was
St. Michael, and <i>we</i> had to be all angels!&#8217;
Wasn&#8217;t it like the duchess; and a beautiful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
testimony to Michael&#8217;s consistent goodness?
Oh, I wish you knew him better. And, for
the matter of that, I wish I knew him better!
But after all I <i>am</i> his wife. Nothing can rob
me of that. And don&#8217;t you think&mdash;when
Michael comes home this time&mdash;somehow, all
will be different; better than ever before?&#8221;</p>
<p>The hall clock chimed three-quarters after
the hour.</p>
<p>The clang of a bell resounded through the
silent house.</p>
<p>Peter sat up, and barked once, sharply.</p>
<p>The doctor rose and stood with his back to
the fire, facing the door.</p>
<p>Myra&#8217;s question remained unanswered.</p>
<p>Hurried steps approached.</p>
<p>A footman entered, with a telegram for
Lady Ingleby.</p>
<p>She took it with calm fingers, and without
the usual sinking of the heart from sudden
apprehension. Her mind was full of the
conversation of the moment, and the doctor&#8217;s
presence made her feel so strong and safe; so
sure of no approach of evil tidings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>She did not hear Sir Deryck&#8217;s quiet voice
say to the man: &#8220;You need not wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the door closed, the doctor turned away,
and stood looking into the fire.</p>
<p>The room was very still.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby opened her telegram, unfolded
it slowly, and read it through twice.</p>
<p>Afterwards she sat on, in such absolute
silence that, at length, the doctor turned and
looked at her.</p>
<p>She met his eyes, quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Deryck,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is from the War
Office. They tell me Michael has been killed.
Do you think it is true?&#8221;</p>
<p>She handed him the telegram. Taking it
from her, he read it in silence. Then: &#8220;Dear
Lady Ingleby,&#8221; he said, very gently, &#8220;I fear
there is no doubt. He has given his life for
his country. You will be as brave in giving
him, as he would wish his wife to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra smiled; but the doctor saw her face
slowly whiten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said; &#8220;oh, yes! I will not fail
him. I will be adequate&mdash;at last.&#8221; Then, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
if a sudden thought had struck her: &#8220;Did you
know of this? Is it why you came?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the doctor, slowly. &#8220;The
duchess sent me. She was at the War Office
this morning when the news came in, inquiring
for Ronald Ingram, who has been wounded,
and is down with fever. She telephoned for
me, and insisted on the telegram being kept
back until six o&#8217;clock this evening, in order to
give me time to get here, and to break the
news to you first, if it seemed well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra gazed at him, wide-eyed. &#8220;And you let
me say all that, about Michael and myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear lady,&#8221; said the doctor, and few
had ever heard that deep firm voice, so nearly
tremulous, &#8220;I could not stop you. But you
did not say one word which was not absolutely
loving and loyal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I have?&#8221; queried Myra, her
face growing whiter, and her eyes wider and
more bright. &#8220;I have never had a thought
which was not loyal and loving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;Poor brave
heart,&mdash;I know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>Myra took up the telegram, and read it
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed,&#8221; she said; &#8220;<i>killed</i>. I wish I knew
how.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The duchess is ready to come to you
immediately, if you would like to have her,&#8221;
suggested the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Myra, smiling vaguely. &#8220;No;
I think not. Not unless dear mamma comes.
If that happens we must wire for the duchess,
because now&mdash;now Michael is away&mdash;she is
the only person who can cope with mamma.
But please not, otherwise; because&mdash;well,
you see,&mdash;she said she could not live up to
Michael; and it does not sound funny now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anybody you would wish sent for
at once?&#8221; inquired the doctor, wondering
how much larger and brighter those big grey
eyes could grow; and whether any living face
had ever been so absolutely colourless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody I should wish sent for at once?
I don&#8217;t know. Oh, yes&mdash;there is one person;
if she could come. Jane&mdash;you know? Jane
Dalmain. I always say she is like the bass of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
a tune; so solid, and satisfactory, and beneath
one. Nothing very bad could happen, if
Jane were there. But of course this <i>has</i>
happened; hasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wired to Gleneesh this morning,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Jane will be here early to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then lots of people knew before I did?&#8221;
said Lady Ingleby.</p>
<p>The doctor did not answer.</p>
<p>She rose, and stood looking down into the
fire; her tall graceful figure drawn up to its
full height, her back to the doctor, whose
watchful eyes never left her for an instant.</p>
<p>Suddenly she looked across to Lord Ingleby&#8217;s
chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I believe <i>Peter</i> knew,&#8221; she said, in a
loud, high-pitched voice. &#8220;Good heavens!
Peter knew; and refused his food because
Michael was dead. And <i>I</i> said he had
dyspepsia! Michael, oh Michael! Your wife
didn&#8217;t know you were dead; but your dog
knew! Oh Michael, Michael! Little Peter
knew!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>She lifted her arms toward the picture of
the big man and the tiny dog.</p>
<p>Then she swayed backward.</p>
<p>The doctor caught her, as she fell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>IN SAFE HANDS</h3>
</div>

<p>All through the night Lady Ingleby lay
gazing before her, with bright unseeing
eyes.</p>
<p>The quiet woman from the Lodge, who had
been, before her own marriage, a devoted
maid-companion to Lady Ingleby, arrived in
speechless sorrow, and helped the doctor
tenderly with all there was to do.</p>
<p>But when consciousness returned, and
realisation, they were accompanied by no
natural expressions of grief; simply a settled
stony silence; the white set face; the bright
unseeing eyes.</p>
<p>Margaret O&#8217;Mara knelt, and wept, and
prayed, kissing the folded hands upon the
silken quilt. But Lady Ingleby merely smiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
vaguely; and once she said: &#8220;Hush, my dear
Maggie. At last we will be adequate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several times during the night the doctor
came, sitting silently beside the bed, with
watchful eyes and quiet touch. Myra scarcely
noticed him, and again he wondered how
much larger the big grey eyes would grow, in
the pale setting of that lovely face.</p>
<p>Once he signed to the other watcher to
follow him into the corridor. Closing the
door, he turned and faced her. He liked this
quiet woman, in her simple black merino
gown, linen collar and cuffs, and neatly
braided hair. There was an air of refinement
and gentle self-control about her, which
pleased the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. O&#8217;Mara,&#8221; he said; &#8220;she must weep,
and she must sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She does not weep easily, sir,&#8221; replied
Margaret O&#8217;Mara, &#8220;and I have known her
to lie widely awake throughout an entire
night with less cause for sorrow than this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the doctor; and he looked
keenly at the woman from the Lodge. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
wonder what else you have known?&#8221; he
thought. But he did not voice the conjecture.
Deryck Brand rarely asked questions of a
third person. His patients never had to find
out that his knowledge of them came through
the gossip or the breach of confidence of
others.</p>
<p>At last he could allow that fixed unseeing
gaze no longer. He decided to do what
was necessary, with a quiet nod, in response
to Margaret O&#8217;Mara&#8217;s imploring look. He
turned back the loose sleeve of the silk nightdress,
one firm hand grasped the soft arm beneath
it; the other passed over it for a moment
with swift skilful pressure. Even Margaret&#8217;s
anxious eyes saw nothing more; and afterwards
Myra often wondered what could have
caused that tiny scar upon the whiteness of
her arm.</p>
<p>Before long she was quietly asleep. The
doctor stood looking down upon her. There
was tragedy to him in this perfect loveliness.
Now the clear candour of the grey eyes was
veiled, the childlike look was no longer there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
It was the face of a woman&mdash;and of a woman
who had lived, and who had suffered.</p>
<p>Watching it, the doctor reviewed the history
of those ten years of wedded life; piecing together
that which she herself had told him;
his own shrewd surmisings; and facts, which
were common knowledge.</p>
<p>So much for the past. The present, for a
few hours at least, was merciful oblivion.
What would the future bring? She had
bravely and faithfully put from her all temptation
to learn the glory of life, and the completeness
of love, from any save from her own
husband. And he had failed to teach. Can
the deaf teach harmony, or the blind reveal
the beauties of blended colour?</p>
<p>But the future held no such limitations.
The &#8220;garden enclosed&#8221; was no longer barred
against all others by an owner who ignored
its fragrance. The gate would be on the
latch, though all unconscious until an eager
hand pressed it, that its bolts and bars were
gone, and it dare swing open wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; mused the doctor. &#8220;Will the right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
man pass by? Youth teaches youth; but is
there a man amongst us strong enough, and
true enough, and pure enough, to teach this
woman, nearing thirty, lessons which should
have been learned during the golden days of
girlhood. Surely somewhere on this earth
the One Man walks, and works, and waits,
to whom she is to be the One Woman? God
send him her way, in the fulness of time.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>And in that very hour&mdash;while at last Myra
slept, and the doctor watched, and mused,
and wondered&mdash;in that very hour, under an
Eastern sky, a strong man, sick of life, worn
and disillusioned, fighting a deadly fever, in
the sultry atmosphere of a soldier&#8217;s tent,
cried out in bitterness of soul: &#8220;O God, let
me die!&#8221; Then added the &#8220;never-the-less&#8221;
which always qualifies a brave soul&#8217;s prayer
for immunity from pain: &#8220;Unless&mdash;unless, O
God, there be still some work left on this earth
which only I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the doctor had just said: &#8220;Send him
her way, O God, in the fulness of time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>The two prayers reached the Throne of
Omniscience together.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Deryck Brand, looking up, saw the quiet
eyes of Margaret O&#8217;Mara gazing gratefully
at him, across the bed. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she
whispered.</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;Never to be done lightly, Mrs.
O&#8217;Mara,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everything else should
be tried first. But there are exceptions to the
strictest rules, and it is fatal weakness to
hesitate when confronted by the exception.
Send for me, when she wakes; and, meanwhile,
lie down on that couch yourself and have
some sleep. You are worn out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor turned away; but not before he
had caught the sudden look of dumb anguish
which leaped into those quiet eyes. He
reached the door; paused a moment; then
came back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. O&#8217;Mara,&#8221; he said, with a hand upon
her shoulder, &#8220;you have a sorrow of your
own?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>She drew away from him, in terror. &#8220;Oh,
hush!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask! Don&#8217;t
unnerve me, sir. Help me to think of her,
only.&#8221; Then, more calmly: &#8220;But of course I
shall think of none but her, while she needs
me. Only&mdash;only, sir&mdash;as you are so kind&mdash;&#8221;
she drew from her bosom a crumpled telegram,
and handed it to the doctor. &#8220;Mine came
at the same time as hers,&#8221; she said, simply.</p>
<p>The doctor unfolded the War Office message.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Regret to report Sergeant O&#8217;Mara killed in
assault on Targai yesterday.</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;He was a good husband,&#8221; said Margaret
O&#8217;Mara, simply; &#8220;and we were very happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor held out his hand. &#8220;I am
proud to have met you, Mrs. O&#8217;Mara.
This seems to me the bravest thing I have
ever known a woman do.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled through her tears. &#8220;Thank
you, sir,&#8221; she said, tremulously. &#8220;But it is
easier to bear my own sorrow, when I have
work to do for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God Himself comfort you, my friend,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
said Deryck Brand, and it was all he could
trust his voice to say; nor was he ashamed
that he had to fumble blindly for the handle
of the door.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The doctor had finished breakfast, and was
asking Groatley for a time-table, when word
reached him that Lady Ingleby was awake.
He went upstairs immediately.</p>
<p>Myra was sitting up in bed, propped with
pillows. Her cheeks were flushed; her eyes
bright and hard.</p>
<p>She held out her hand to the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;How good you have been,&#8221; she said,
speaking very fast, in a high unnatural voice:
&#8220;I am afraid I have given you a great deal of
trouble. I don&#8217;t remember much about last
night, excepting that they said Michael had
been killed. Has Michael really been killed,
do you think? And will they give me details?
Surely I have a right to know details. Nothing
can alter the fact that I was Michael&#8217;s
wife, can it? Do go to breakfast, Maggie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
There is nothing gained by standing there,
smiling, and saying you do not want any
breakfast. Everybody wants breakfast at
nine o&#8217;clock in the morning. I should want
breakfast, if Michael had not been killed.
Tell her she ought to have breakfast, Sir
Deryck. I believe she has been up all night.
It is such a comfort to have her. She is so
brave and bright; and so full of sympathy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is very brave,&#8221; said the doctor;
&#8220;and you are right as to her need of breakfast.
Go down-stairs for a little while, Mrs. O&#8217;Mara.
I will stay with Lady Ingleby.&#8221;</p>
<p>She moved obediently to the door; but Sir
Deryck reached it before her. And the
famous London specialist held the door open
for the sergeant&#8217;s young widow, with an air
of deference such as he would hardly have
bestowed upon a queen.</p>
<p>Then he came back to Lady Ingleby. His
train left in three-quarters of an hour. But his
task here was not finished. She had slept;
but before he dare leave her, she must weep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Peter?&#8221; inquired the excited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
voice from the bed. &#8220;He always barks to be
let out, in the morning; but I have heard
nothing of him yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was exhausted last night, poor little
chap,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;He could scarcely
walk. I carried him up, myself; and put him
on the bed in the next room. The coat was
still there, I wrapped him in it. He licked
my hand, and lay down, content.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see him,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby.
&#8220;Michael loved him. He seems all I have
left of Michael.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will fetch him,&#8221; said the doctor.</p>
<p>He went into the adjoining room, leaving
the door ajar. Myra heard him reach the
bed. Then followed a long silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she called at last. &#8220;Is he
not there? Why are you so long?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the doctor came back. He carried
something in his arms, wrapped in the old
shooting jacket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Lady Ingleby,&#8221; he said, &#8220;little Peter
is dead. He must have died during the night,
in his sleep. He was lying just as I left him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
curled up in the coat; but he is quite cold and
stiff. Faithful little heart!&#8221; said the doctor,
with emotion, holding his burden, tenderly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Myra, with both arms outstretched.
&#8220;Peter has died, because Michael
is dead; and I&mdash;I have not even shed a tear!&#8221;
She fell back among the pillows in a paroxysm
of weeping.</p>
<p>The doctor stood by, silently; uncertain
what to do. Myra&#8217;s sobs grew more violent,
shaking the bed with their convulsive force.
Then she began to shriek inarticulately about
Michael and Peter, and to sob again, with
renewed violence.</p>
<p>At that moment the doctor heard the horn
of a motor-car in the avenue; then, almost
immediately, the clang of the bell, and the
sounds of an arrival below. A look of immense
relief came into his face. He went
to the top of the great staircase, and looked
over.</p>
<p>The Honourable Mrs. Dalmain had arrived.
The doctor saw her tall figure, in a dark green
travelling coat, walk rapidly across the hall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jane!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Jeanette! Ah, I knew
you would not fail us! Come straight up.
You have arrived at the right moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane looked up, and saw the doctor standing
at the top of the stairs; something wrapped
in an old coat, held carefully in his arms. She
threw him one smile of greeting and assurance;
then, wasting no time in words, rapidly
pulled off her coat, hat, and fur gloves, flinging
them in quick succession to the astonished
butler. The doctor only waited to see her
actually mounting the stairs. Then, passing
through Lady Ingleby&#8217;s room, he laid Peter&#8217;s
little body back on his dead master&#8217;s bed,
still wrapped in the old tweed coat.</p>
<p>As he stepped back into Lady Ingleby&#8217;s
room, closing the door between, he saw Jane
Dalmain kneel down beside the bed, and
gather the weeping form into her arms, with
a gesture of immense protective tenderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Jane,&#8221; sobbed Lady Ingleby, as she
hid her face in the sweet comfort of that
generous bosom; &#8220;Oh Jane! Michael has been
killed! And little Peter died, because Michael
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
was dead. Little Peter <i>died</i>, and <i>I</i> had not
even shed a tear!&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor passed quickly out, closing the
door behind him. He did not wait to hear
the answer. He knew it would be wise, and
kind, and right. He left his patient in safe
hands. Jane was there, at last. All would
be well.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>LADY INGLEBY&#8217;S REST-CURE</h3>
</div>

<p>From the moment when the express for
Cornwall had slowly but irrevocably
commenced to glide away from the Paddington
platform; when she had looked her last upon
Margaret O&#8217;Mara&#8217;s anxious devoted face,
softly framed in her simple widow&#8217;s bonnet;
when she had realised that her somewhat
original rest-cure had really safely commenced,
and that she was leaving, not only her worries,
but her very identity behind her&mdash;Lady Ingleby
had leaned back with closed eyes in a corner
of her reserved compartment, and given herself
up to quiet retrospection.</p>
<p>The face, in repose, was sad&mdash;a quiet sadness,
as of regret which held no bitterness.
The cheek, upon which the dark fringe of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
lashes rested, was white and thin having lost
the tint and contour of perfect health. But,
every now and then, during those hours of
retrospection, the wistful droop of the sweet
expressive mouth curved into a smile, and a
dimple peeped out unexpectedly, giving a
look of youthfulness to the tired face.</p>
<p>When London and, its suburbs were completely
left behind, and the summer sunshine
blazed through the window from the clear
blue of a radiant June sky, Lady Ingleby
leaned forward, watching the rapid unfolding
of country lanes and hedges; wide commons,
golden with gorse; fir woods, carpeted with
blue-bells; mossy banks, overhung with wild
roses, honeysuckle, and traveller&#8217;s-joy; the
indescribable greenness and soft fragrance of
England in early summer; and, as she watched,
a responsive light shone in her sweet grey eyes.
The drear sadness of autumn, the deadness of
winter, the chill uncertainty of spring&mdash;all
these were over and gone. &#8220;Flowers appear
on the earth; the time of the singing of birds
is come,&#8221; murmurs the lover of Canticles; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
in Myra Ingleby&#8217;s sad heart there blossomed
timidly, flowers of hope; vague promise of
future joy, which life might yet hold in store.
A blackbird in the hawthorn, trilled gaily; and
Myra softly sang, to an air of Garth Dalmain&#8217;s,
the &#8220;Blackbird&#8217;s Song.&#8221;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Wake, wake,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Then, as the train sped onward through
Wiltshire, Somerset, and Devon, Lady Ingleby
felt the mantle of her despondence slipping
from her, and reviewed the past, much as a
prisoner might glance back into his dark
narrow cell, from the sunlight of the open door,
as he stood at last on the threshold of liberty.</p>
<p>Seven months had gone by since, on that
chill November evening, the news of Lord
Ingleby&#8217;s death had reached Shenstone. The
happenings of the weeks which followed, now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
seemed vague and dreamlike to Myra, just
a few events standing out clearly from the
dim blur of misery. She remembered the
reliable strength of the doctor; the unselfish
devotion of Margaret O&#8217;Mara; the unspeakable
comfort of Jane&#8217;s wholesome understanding
tenderness. Then the dreaded arrival of her
mother; followed, immediately, according to
promise, by the protective advent of Georgina,
Duchess of Meldrum; after which, tragedy and
comedy walked hand in hand; and the silence
of mourning was enlivened by the &#8220;Hoity-toity!&#8221;
of the duchess, and the indignant
sniffs of Mrs. Coller-Cray.</p>
<p>Later on, details of Lord Ingleby&#8217;s death
came to hand, and his widow had to learn that
he had fallen&mdash;at the attempt upon Targai,
it is true&mdash;but the victim of an accident;
losing his life, not at the hands of the savage
enemy, but through the unfortunate blunder
of a comrade. Myra never very clearly
grasped the details:&mdash;a wall to be undermined;
his own patent and fearful explosive; the
grim enthusiasm with which he insisted upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
placing it himself, arranging to have it fired
by his patent electrical plan. Then the mistaking
of a signal; the fatal pressing of a button
five minutes too soon; an electric flash
in the mine, a terrific explosion, and instant
death to the man whose skill and courage had
made the gap through which crowds of cheering
British soldiers, bursting from the silent
darkness, dashed to expectant victory.</p>
<p>When full details reached the War Office,
a Very Great Personage called at her house in
Park Lane personally to explain to Lady
Ingleby the necessity for the hushing up of
some of these greatly-to-be-deplored facts.
The whole unfortunate occurrence had largely
partaken of the nature of an experiment.
The explosive, the new method of signalling,
the portable electric plant&mdash;all these were
being used by Lord Ingleby and the young
officers who assisted him, more or less
experimentally and unofficially. The man
whose unfortunate mistake caused the accident
had an important career before him.
His name must not be allowed to transpire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
It would be unfair that a future of great
promise should be blighted by what was an
obvious accident. The few to whom the
name was known had been immediately
pledged to secrecy. Of course it would be
confidentially given to Lady Ingleby if she
really desired to hear it, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Then Myra took a very characteristic line.
She sat up with instant decision; her pale face
flushed, and her large pathetic grey eyes shone
with sudden brightness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, sir,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for interposing;
but I never wish to know that name. My
husband would have been the first to desire
that it should not be told. And, personally,
I should be sorry that there should be any
man on earth whose hand I could not bring
myself to touch in friendship. The hand that
widowed me, did so without intention. Let
it remain always to me an abstract instrument
of the will of Providence. I shall never even
try to guess to which of Michael&#8217;s comrades
that hand belonged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby was honest in making this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
decision; and the Very Great Personage
stepped into his brougham, five minutes later,
greatly relieved, and filled with admiration for
Lord Ingleby&#8217;s beautiful and right-minded
widow. She had always been all that was
most charming. Now she added sound good
sense, to personal charm. Excellent! Incomparable!
Poor Ingleby! Poor&mdash;Ah! <i>he</i>
must not be mentioned, even in thought.</p>
<p>Yes; Lady Ingleby was absolutely honest
in coming to her decision. And yet, from
that moment, two names revolved perpetually
in her mind, around a ceaseless question&mdash;the
only men mentioned constantly by Michael
in his letters as being always with him in his
experiments, sharing his interests and his dangers:
Ronald Ingram, and Billy Cathcart&mdash;dear
boys, both; her devoted adorers; almost her
dearest, closest friends; faithful, trusted, tried.
And now the haunting question circled around
all thought of them: &#8220;Was it Ronald? Or
was it Billy? Which? Billy or Ronnie?
Ronnie or Billy?&#8221; Myra had said: &#8220;I shall
never even try to guess,&#8221; and she had said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
it honestly. She did not try to guess. She
guessed, in spite of trying not to do so; and
the certainty, and yet <i>un</i>certainty of her
surmisings told on her nerves, becoming a
cause of mental torment which was with her,
subconsciously, night and day.</p>
<p>Time went on. The frontier war was over.
England, as ever, had been bound to win in the
end; and England had won. It had merely
been a case of time; of learning wisdom by a
series of initial mistakes; of expending a large
amount of British gold and British blood.
England&#8217;s supremacy was satisfactorily asserted;
and, those of her brave troops who had
survived the initial mistakes, came home;
among them Ronald Ingram and Billy Cathcart;
the former obviously older than when he
went away, gaunt and worn, pale beneath his
bronze, showing unmistakable signs of the
effects of a severe wound and subsequent
fever. &#8220;Too interesting for words,&#8221; said the
Duchess of Meldrum to Lady Ingleby, recounting
her first sight of him. &#8220;If only I
were fifty years younger than I am, I would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
marry the dear boy immediately, take him
down to Overdene, and nurse him back to
health and strength. Oh, you need not look
incredulous, my dear Myra! I always
mean what I say, as you very well
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Lady Ingleby denied all suspicion of
incredulity, and merely suggested languidly,
that&mdash;bar the matrimonial suggestion&mdash;the
programme was an excellent one, and might
well be carried out. Young Ronald being of
the same opinion, he was soon installed at
Overdene, and had what he afterwards described
as <i>the</i> time of his life, being pampered,
spoiled, and petted by the dear old duchess,
and never allowing her to suspect that one of
the chief attractions of Overdene lay in the
fact that it was within easy motoring distance
of Shenstone Park.</p>
<p>Billy returned as young, as inconsequent, as
irrepressible as ever. And yet in him also,
Myra was conscious of a subtle change, for
which she, all too readily, found a reason, far
removed from the real one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>The fact was this. Both young men, in
their romantic devotion to her, had yet been
true to their own manhood, and loyal, at
heart, to Lord Ingleby. But their loyalty
had always been with effort. Therefore, when&mdash;the
strain relaxed&mdash;they met her again, they
were intensely conscious of her freedom and
of their own resultant liberty. This produced
in them, when with her, a restraint
and shyness which Myra naturally construed
into a confirmation of her own suspicions.
She, having never found it the smallest effort
to remember she was Michael&#8217;s, and to be
faithful in every thought to him, was quite
unconscious of her liberty. There having
been no strain in remaining true to the instincts
of her own pure, honest, honourable
nature, there was no tension to
relax.</p>
<p>So it very naturally came to pass that when
one day Ronald Ingram had sat long with her,
silently studying his boots, his strong face
tense and miserable, every now and then
looking furtively at her, then, as his eyes met
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
the calm friendliness of hers, dropping them
again to the floor:&mdash;&#8220;Poor Ronnie,&#8221; she
mused, &#8220;with his &#8216;important career&#8217; before
him. Undoubtedly it was he who did it.
And Billy knows it. See how fidgety Billy
is, while Ronnie sits with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But by-and-by it would be: &#8220;No; of course
it was Billy&mdash;dear hot-headed impulsive young
Billy; and Ronald, knowing it, feels guilty
also. Poor little Billy, who was as a son to
Michael! There was no mistaking the emotion
in his face just now, when I merely laid my
hand on his. Oh, impetuous scatter-brained
boy!... Dear heavens! I wish he wouldn&#8217;t
hand me the bread-and-butter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, into this atmosphere of misunderstanding
and uncertainty, intruded a fresh
element. A first-cousin of Lord Ingleby&#8217;s,
to whom had come the title, minus the estates,
came to the conclusion that title and estates
might as well go together. To that end,
intruding upon her privacy on every possible
occasion, he proceeded to pay business-like
court to Lady Ingleby.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>Thus rudely Myra awoke to the understanding
of her liberty. At once, her whole
outlook on life was changed. All things bore
a new significance. Ronnie and Billy ceased
to be comforts. Ronnie&#8217;s nervous misery
assumed a new importance; and, coupled
with her own suspicions, filled her with a dismayed
horror. The duchess&#8217;s veiled jokes
took point, and hurt. A sense of unprotected
loneliness engulfed her. Every man became a
prospective and dreaded suitor; every woman&#8217;s
remarks seemed to hold an innuendo. Her
name in the papers distracted her.</p>
<p>She recognised the morbidness of her condition,
even while she felt unable to cope with
it; and, leaving Shenstone suddenly, came
up to town, and consulted Sir Deryck Brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my friend,&#8221; she said, &#8220;help me! I
shall never face life again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor heard her patiently, aiding the
recital by his strong understanding silence.</p>
<p>Then he said, quietly: &#8220;Dear lady, the
diagnosis is not difficult. Also there is but
one possible remedy.&#8221; He paused.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>Lady Ingleby&#8217;s imploring eyes and tense
expectancy, besought his verdict.</p>
<p>&#8220;A rest-cure,&#8221; said the doctor, with finality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Horrors, no!&#8221; cried Myra; &#8220;Would you
shut me up within four walls; cram me with
rice pudding and every form of food I most
detest; send a dreadful woman to pound,
roll, and pommel me, and tell me gruesome
stories; keep out all my friends, all letters, all
books, all news; and, after six weeks send me
out into the world again, with my figure gone,
and not a sane thought upon any subject
under the sun? Dear doctor, think of it!
Stout, and an idiot! Oh, give me something
in a bottle, to shake, and take three times a
day&mdash;and let me go!&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor smiled. He was famed for his
calm patience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your somewhat highly coloured description,
dear Lady Ingleby, applies to a form of
rest-cure such as I rarely, if ever, recommend.
In your case it would be worse than useless.
We should gain nothing by shutting you up
with the one person who is doing you harm,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
and from whom we must contrive your escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The one person&mdash;?&#8221; queried Myra, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;A charming person,&#8221; smiled the doctor,
&#8220;where the rest of mankind are concerned;
but very bad for you just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;whom?&#8221; questioned Myra, again.
&#8220;Whom can you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean Lady Ingleby,&#8221; replied the doctor,
gravely. &#8220;When I send you away for your
rest-cure, Lady Ingleby with her worries and
questionings, doubts and fears, must be left
behind. I shall send you to a little out-of-the-world
village on the wild sea coast of
Cornwall, where you know nobody, and nobody
knows you. You must go incognito, as
&#8216;Miss&#8217; or &#8216;Mrs.&#8217;&mdash;anything you please. Your
rest-cure will consist primarily in being set
free, for a time, from Lady Ingleby&#8217;s position,
predicament, and perplexities. You must
send word to all intimate friends, telling
them you are going into retreat, and they
must not write until they hear again. You
will have leave to write one letter a week, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
one person only; and that person must be
one of whom I can approve. You must eat
plenty of wholesome food; roam about all day
long in the open-air; rise early, retire early;
live entirely in a simple, beautiful, wholesome
present, firmly avoiding all remembrance of a
sad past, and all anticipation of an uncertain
future. Nobody is to know where you are,
excepting myself, and the one friend to whom
you may write. But we will arrange that
somebody&mdash;say, for instance, your devoted
attendant from the Lodge, shall hold herself
free to come to you at an hour&#8217;s notice, should
you be overwhelmed with a sudden sense
of loneliness. The knowledge of this, will
probably keep the need from arising. You
can communicate with me daily if you like, by
letter or by telegram; but other people must
not know where you are. I do not wish you
followed by the anxious or restless thoughts of
many minds. To-morrow I will give you the
name of a place I recommend, and of a comfortable
hotel where you can order rooms.
It must be a place you have never seen, probably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
one of which you have never heard. We
are nearing the end of May. I should like you
to start on the first of June. If you want a
house-party at Shenstone this summer, you
may invite your guests for the first of July.
Lady Ingleby will be at home again by then,
fully able to maintain her reputation as a
hostess of unequalled charm, graciousness,
and popularity. Morbid self-consciousness
is a condition of mind from which you have
hitherto been so completely free, that this unexpected
attack has altogether unnerved you,
and requires prompt and uncompromising
measures.... Yes, Jane Dalmain may be
your correspondent. You could not have
chosen better.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the doctor&#8217;s verdict and prescription;
and, as his patients never disputed
the one, or declined to take the other, Myra
found herself, on &#8220;the glorious first of June&#8221;
flying south in the Great Western express,
bound for the little fishing village of Tregarth
where she had ordered rooms at the Moorhead
Inn, in the name of Mrs. O&#8217;Mara.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>AT THE MOORHEAD INN</h3>
</div>

<p>The ruddy glow of a crimson sunset
illumined cliff and hamlet, tinting the
distant ocean into every shade of golden
glory, as Myra walked up the gravelled path
to the rustic porch of the Moorhead Inn, and
looked around her with a growing sense of
excited refreshment.</p>
<p>She had come on foot from the little wayside
station, her luggage following in a barrow;
and this mode of progression, minus a
footman and maid, and carrying her own
cloak, umbrella, and travelling-bag, was in
itself a charming novelty.</p>
<p>At the door, she was received by the
proprietress, a stately lady in black satin,
wearing a double row of large jet beads, who
reminded her instantly of all Lord Ingleby&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
maiden aunts. She seemed an accentuated,
dignified, concentrated embodiment of them
all; and Myra longed for Billy, to share the
joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Ingleby&#8221; requested Mrs. O&#8217;Mara to
walk in, and hoped she had had a pleasant
journey. Then she rang a very loud bell
twice, in order to summon a maid to show her
to her room; and, the maid not appearing at
once, requested Mrs. O&#8217;Mara meanwhile to
write her name in the visitors&#8217; book.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby walked into the hall, passing
a smoking-room on the left, and, noting a
door, with &#8220;Coffee Room&#8221; upon it in gold
lettering, down a short passage immediately
opposite. Up from the centre of the hall, on
her right, went the rather wide old-fashioned
staircase; and opposite to it, against the wall,
between the smoking-room and a door labelled
&#8220;Reception Room,&#8221; stood a marble-topped
table. Lying open upon this table was a
ponderous visitors&#8217; book. A fresh page had
been recently commenced, as yet only containing
four names. The first three were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
dated May the 8th, and read, in crabbed
precise writing:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Miss Amelia Murgatroyd,
Miss Eliza Murgatroyd,
Miss Susannah Murgatroyd ..... Lawn View, Putney.</p>
</div>
<p>Below these, bearing date a week later, in
small precise writing of unmistakable character
and clearness, the name:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Jim Airth ..... London.</p>
</div>
<p>Pen and ink lay ready, and, without troubling
to remove her glove, Lady Ingleby
wrote beneath, in large, somewhat sprawling,
handwriting:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Mrs. O&#8217;Mara ..... The Lodge, Shenstone.</p>
</div>
<p>A maid appeared, took her cloak and bag,
and preceded her up the stairs.</p>
<p>As she reached the turn of the staircase,
Lady Ingleby paused, and looked back into
the hall.</p>
<p>The door of the smoking-room opened, and
a very tall man came out, taking a pipe from
the pocket of his loose Norfolk jacket. As
he strolled into the hall, his face reminded
her of Ronnie&#8217;s, deep-bronzed and thin; only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
it was an older face&mdash;strong, rugged, purposeful.
The heavy brown moustache could not
hide the massive cut of chin and jaw.</p>
<p>Catching sight of a fresh name in the book,
he paused; then laying one large hand upon
the table, bent over and read it.</p>
<p>Myra stood still and watched, noting the
broad shoulders, and the immense length of
limb in the leather leggings.</p>
<p>He appeared to study the open page longer
than was necessary for the mere reading of
the name. Then, without looking round,
reached up, took a cap from the antler of a
stag&#8217;s head high up on the wall, stuck it on the
back of his head; swung round, and went out
through the porch, whistling like a blackbird.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Airth,&#8221; said Myra to herself, as she
moved slowly on; &#8220;Jim Airth of <i>London</i>.
What an address! He might just as well have
put: &#8216;of the world!&#8217; A cross between a
guardsman and a cowboy; and very likely he
will turn out to be a commercial-traveller.&#8221;
Then, as she reached the landing and came in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
sight of the rosy-cheeked maid, holding open
the door of a large airy bedroom, she added
with a whimsical smile: &#8220;All the same, I wish
I had taken the trouble to write more neatly.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>MRS. O&#8217;MARA&#8217;S CORRESPONDENCE</h3>
</div>

<p><i>Letter from Lady Ingleby to the Honourable
Mrs. Dalmain.</i></p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>The Moorhead Inn,</p>
<p>Tregarth, Cornwall.</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Jane</span>,</p>
<p>Having been here a week, I think it is time
I commenced my first letter to you.</p>
<p>How does it feel to be a person considered
pre-eminently suitable to minister to a mind
diseased? Doesn&#8217;t it give you a sense of
being, as it were, rice pudding, or Brand&#8217;s
essence, or Maltine; something essentially safe
and wholesome? You should have heard how
Sir Deryck jumped at you, as soon as your
name was mentioned, tentatively, as my possible
correspondent. I had barely whispered
it, when he leapt, and clinched the matter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
I believe &#8220;wholesome&#8221; was an adjective mentioned.
I hope you do not mind, dear Jane.
I must confess, I would sooner be macaroons
or oyster-patties, even at the risk of giving
my friends occasional indigestion. But then I
have never gone in for the rôle of being helpful,
in which you excel. Not that it is a &#8220;rôle&#8221; with
you, dear Jane. Rather, it is an essential
characteristic. You walk in, and find a hopeless
tangle; gather up the threads in those
firm capable hands; deftly sort and hold
them; and, lo, the tangle is over; the skein of
life is once more ready for winding!</p>
<p>Well, there is not much tangle about me
just now, thanks to our dear doctor&#8217;s most
excellent prescription. It was a veritable
stroke of genius, this setting me free from
myself. From the first day, the sense of
emancipation was indescribable. I enjoy being
addressed as &#8220;Ma&#8217;am&#8221;; I revel in being
without a maid, though it takes me ages to
do my hair, and I have serious thoughts of
wearing it in pigtails down my back! When
I remember the poor, harassed, exhausted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
society-self I left behind, I feel like buying a
wooden spade and bucket and starting out,
all by myself, to build sand-castles on this
delightful shore. I have no one to play with,
for I am certain the Miss Murgatroyds&mdash;I
am going to tell you of them&mdash;never made
sand-castles; no, not even in their infancy,
a century ago! They must always have been
the sort of children who wore white frilled
bloomers, poplin frocks, and large leghorn
hats with ribbons tied beneath their excellent
little chins, and walked demurely with their
governess&mdash;looking shocked at other infants
who whooped and ran. I feel inclined to
whoop and run, now; and the Miss Murgatroyds
are quite prepared to look shocked.</p>
<p>But oh, the freedom of being nobody, and
of having nothing to think of or do! And
everything I see and hear gives me joy; a lark
rising from the turf, and carolling its little
self up into the blue; the great Atlantic
breakers, pounding upon the shore; the fisher-folk,
standing at the doors of their picturesque
thatched cottages. All things seem alive,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
with an exuberance of living, to which I have
long been a stranger.</p>
<p>Do you know this coast, with its high
moorland, its splendid cliffs; and, far below,
its sand coves, and ever-moving, rolling, surging,
deep green sea? Wonderful! Beautiful!
Infinite!</p>
<p>My Inn is charming; primitive, yet comfortable.
We have excellent coffee, fried fish
in perfection; real nursery toast, farm butter,
and home-made bread. When you supplement
these with marmalade and mulberry
jam, other things all cease to be necessities.</p>
<p>Stray travellers come and go in motors,
merely lunching, or putting up for one night;
but there are only four other permanent
guests. These all furnish me with unceasing
interest and amusement. The three Miss
Murgatroyds&mdash;oh, Jane, they are so antediluvian
and quaint! Three ancient sisters,&mdash;by
name, Amelia, Eliza, and Susannah. Their
villa at Putney rejoices in the name of &#8220;Lawn
View&#8221;; so characteristic and suitable; because
no view reaching beyond the limits of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
own front lawn appears to these dear ladies
to be worthy of regard. They never go
abroad, &#8220;excepting to the Isle of Wight,&#8221; because
they &#8220;do not like foreigners.&#8221; A party
of quite charming Americans arrived just
before dinner the other day, in an automobile,
and kept us lively during their flying visit.
They were cordial over the consommé; friendly
over the fish; and quite confidential by the
time we reached the third course. But, alas,
these delightful cousins from the other
side, were considered &#8220;foreigners&#8221; by the
Miss Murgatroyds, who consequently encased
themselves in the frigid armour of their own
self-conscious primness; and passed the mustard,
without a smile. I felt constrained, afterwards,
to apologise for my country-women;
but the Americans, overflowing with appreciative
good-nature, explained that they had
come over expressly in order to see old British
relics of every kind. They asked me whether
I did not think the Miss Murgatroyds might
have stepped &#8220;right out of Dickens.&#8221; I was
fairly nonplussed, because I thought they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
were going to say &#8220;out of the ark&#8221;&mdash;you know
how one mentally finishes a sentence as soon
as it is begun?&mdash;and I simply dared not
confess that I have not read Dickens! Alas,
how ignorant of our own standard literature
we are apt to feel when we talk with Americans,
and find it completely a part of their
everyday life.</p>
<p>But I must tell you more about the Miss
Murgatroyds&mdash;Amelia, Eliza, and Susannah.
When quite at peace among themselves, which
is not often, they are Milly, Lizzie, and Susie;
but a little rift within the lute is marked by
the immediate use of their full baptismal
names. Poor Susannah being the youngest&mdash;the
youthful side of sixty&mdash;and inclined to
be kittenish and giddy, is very rarely &#8220;Susie.&#8221;
Miss Murgatroyd&mdash;Amelia&mdash;is stern and unbending.
She wears a cameo brooch the size
of a tablespoon, and lays down the law in
precise and elegant English, even when
asking Susie to pass the crumpets. Miss
Eliza, the second sister, is meek and unoffending.
Her attitude toward Miss Amelia is one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
of perpetual apology. She addresses Susie
as &#8220;my dear love,&#8221; excepting on occasions
when Susie&#8217;s behaviour has put her quite
outside the pale. Then she calls her, &#8220;my
<i>dear</i> Susannah!&#8221; and sighs. I am inclined
to think Miss Eliza suffers from a demonstrative
nature, which has never had an outlet.</p>
<p>But Susie is the lively one. Susie would
be a flirt, if she dared, and if any man were
bold enough to flirt with her under Miss
Amelia&#8217;s eye. Susie is barely fifty-five, and
her elder sisters regard her as a mere child,
and are very ready with reproof and correction.
Susie has a pink and white complexion, a soft
fat little face, and plump dimpled hands;
and Susie is given to vanity. Jim Airth held
open the door of the coffee-room for her one
day, and Susie&mdash;I should say Susannah&mdash;has
been in a flutter ever since. Poor naughty
Susie! Miss Murgatroyd has changed her
place at meals&mdash;they have a table in the centre
of the room&mdash;and made her sit with her back
to Jim Airth; who has a round table, all to
himself, in the window.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>Now I must tell you about Jim Airth, and of
a curious coincidence connected with him,
which you must not repeat to the doctor, for
fear he should move me on.</p>
<p>Let me confess at once, that I am extremely
interested in Jim Airth&mdash;and it is sweet and
generous of me to admit it, for Jim Airth is
not in the least interested in me! He rarely
vouchsafes me a word or a glance. He is a
bear, and a savage; but such a fine good-looking
bear; and such a splendid and interesting
savage! He is quite the tallest man I ever saw;
with immense limbs, lean and big-boned; yet
moves with the supple grace of an Indian.
He was through that campaign last year, and
had a terrible turn of sunstroke and fever,
during which his head was shaved. Consequently
his thick brown hair is now at the
stage of standing straight up all over it like a
bottle-brush. I know Susie longs to smooth
it down; but that would be a task beyond
Susie&#8217;s utmost efforts. His brows are very
stern and level; and his eyes, deep-set beneath
them, of that gentian blue which makes one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
think of Alpine heights. They can flash and
gleam, on occasions, and sometimes look almost
purple. He wears a heavy brown
moustache, and his jaw and chin are terrifying
in their masterful strength. Yet he smokes an
old briar pipe; whistles like a blackbird; and
derives immense amusement from playing up
to naughty Susie&#8217;s coyness, when the cameo
brooch is turned another way. I have seen
his eyes twinkle with fun when Miss Susannah
has purposely let fall her handkerchief, and he
has reached out a long arm, picked it up, and
restored it. Whereupon Susie has hastened
out, in the wake of her sisters, in a blushing
flutter; Miss Eliza turning to whisper: &#8220;Oh,
my dear love! Oh Susannah!&#8221; I try, when
these things happen, to catch Jim Airth&#8217;s
merry eye, and share the humour of the
situation; but he stolidly sees the wall through
me on all occasions, and would tread heavily
on <i>my</i> poor handkerchief, if I took to dropping
it. Miss Murgatroyd tells me that he is a
confirmed hater of feminine beauty; upon
which poor Miss Susannah takes a surreptitious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
prink into the gold-framed mirror over
the reception-room mantelpiece, and says,
plaintively: &#8220;Oh, do not say that, Amelia!&#8221;
But Amelia <i>does</i> say &#8220;that&#8221;; and a good deal
more!</p>
<p>When first I saw Jim Airth, I thought him
a cross between a cowboy and a guardsman;
and I think so still. But what do you
suppose he turns out to be, beside? An
author! And, stranger still, he is writing
an important book called <i>Modern Warfare;
its Methods and Requirements</i>, in which he is
explaining and working out many of Michael&#8217;s
ideas and experiments. He was right through
that border war, and took part in the assault
on Targai. He must have known Michael,
intimately.</p>
<p>All this information I have from Miss
Murgatroyd. I sometimes sit with them
in the reception-room after dinner, where
they wind wool and knit&mdash;endless winding;
perpetual knitting! At five minutes to
ten, Miss Murgatroyd says; &#8220;Now, my dear
Eliza. Now, Susannah,&#8221; which is the signal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
for bestowing all their goods and chattels into
black satin work-bags. Then, at ten o&#8217;clock
precisely, Miss Murgatroyd rises, and they
procession up to bed&mdash;ah, no! I beg their
pardons. The Miss Murgatroyds never &#8220;go
to bed.&#8221; They all &#8220;retire to rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth and his doings form a favourite
topic of conversation. They speak of him as
&#8220;Mr. Airth,&#8221; which sounds so funny. He is
not the sort of person one ever could call
&#8220;Mister.&#8221; To me, he has been &#8220;Jim Airth,&#8221;
ever since I saw his name, in small neat
writing, in the visitors&#8217; book. I had to put
mine just beneath it, and of course I wrote
&#8220;Mrs. O&#8217;Mara&#8221;; then, as an address seemed expected,
added: &#8220;The Lodge, Shenstone.&#8221; Just
after I had written this, Jim Airth came into
the hall, and stood quite still studying it.
I saw him, from half-way up the stairs. At
first I thought he was marvelling at my
shocking handwriting; but now I believe the
name &#8220;Shenstone&#8221; caught his eye. No
doubt he knew it to be Michael&#8217;s family-seat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>Do you know, it was so strange, the other
night, Miss Murgatroyd held forth in the
reception-room about Michael&#8217;s death. She
explained that he was &#8220;the first to dash into
the breach,&#8221; and &#8220;fell with his face to the foe.&#8221;
She also added that she used to know &#8220;poor
dear Lady Ingleby,&#8221; intimately. This was
interesting, and seemed worthy of further
inquiry. It turned out that she is a distant
cousin of a weird old person who used to call
every year on mamma, for a subscription to
some society for promoting thrift among the
inhabitants of the South Sea Islands. Dear
mamma used annually to jump upon this
courageous old party and flatten her out; and
listening to the process was, to us, a fearful
joy; but annually she returned to the charge.
On one of these occasions, just before my
marriage, Miss Murgatroyd accompanied her.
Hence her intimate knowledge of &#8220;poor dear
Lady Ingleby.&#8221; Also she has a friend who,
quite recently, saw Lady Ingleby driving in
the Park; &#8220;and, poor thing, she had sadly gone
off in looks.&#8221; I felt inclined to prink in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
golden mirror, after the manner of Susie, and
exclaim: &#8220;Oh, do not say that, Amelia!&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it queer the way in which such people
as these worthy ladies, yearn to be able to say
they know us; for really, when all is said and
done, we are not very much worth knowing?
I would rather know a cosmopolitan cowboy,
such as Jim Airth, than half the titled folk on
my visiting-list.</p>
<p>But really, Jane, I must not mention him
again, or you will think I am infected with
Susie&#8217;s flutter. Not so, my dear! He has
shown me no little courtesies; given few signs
of being conscious of my presence; barely
returned my morning greeting, though my
lonely table is just opposite his, in the large
bay-window.</p>
<p>But in this new phase of life, everything
seems of absorbing interest, and the individuality
of the few people I see, takes on an
exaggerated importance. (Really that sentence
might almost be Sir Deryck&#8217;s!) Also,
I really believe Jim Airth&#8217;s peculiar fascination
consists in the fact that I am conscious of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
disapproval. If he thinks of me at all, it is
not with admiration, nor even with liking.
And this is a novel experience; for I have been
spoilt by perpetual approval, and satiated by
senseless and unmerited adulation.</p>
<p>Oh Jane! As I walk along these cliffs,
and hear the Atlantic breakers pounding
against their base, far down below; as I watch
the sea-gulls circling around on their strong
white wings; as I realise the strength, the
force, the liberty, in nature; the growth and
progress which accompanies life; I feel I have
never really lived. Nothing has ever felt
<i>strong</i>, either beneath me, or around me, or
against me. Had I once been mastered, and
held, and made to do as another willed, I
should have felt love was a reality, and life
would have become worth living. But I
have just dawdled through the years, doing
exactly as I pleased; making mistakes, and
nobody troubling to set me right; failing, and
nobody disappointed that I had not succeeded.</p>
<p>I realise now, that there is a key to life, and
a key to love, which has never been placed in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
my hands. What it is, I know not. But if
I ever learn, it will be from just such a man as
Jim Airth. I have never really talked with
him, yet I am so conscious of his strength and
virility, that he stands to me, in the abstract,
for all that is strongest in manhood, and
most vital in life.</p>
<p>Much of the benefit of my time here, quite
unconsciously to himself, comes to me from
him. When he walks into the house, whistling
like a blackbird; when he hangs up his cap
on an antler a foot or two higher than other
people could reach; when he ploughs unhesitatingly
through his meals, with a book or
a paper stuck up in front of him; when he
dumps his big boots out into the passage,
long after the quiet house has hushed into
repose, and I smile, in the darkness, at the
thought of how the sound will have annoyed
Miss Murgatroyd, startled Miss Eliza, and
made naughty Miss Susannah&#8217;s heart flutter;&mdash;when
all these things happen every day,
I am conscious that a clearer understanding
of the past, a new strength for the future, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
a fresh outlook on life, come to me, simply
from the fact that he is himself, and that he is
here. Jim Airth may not be a saint; but he is
a <i>man!</i></p>
<p>Dear Jane, I should scarcely venture to send
you this epistle, were it not for all the adjectives&mdash;&#8220;wholesome,&#8221;
&#8220;helpful,&#8221; &#8220;understanding,&#8221;
etc., which so rightly apply to you.
<i>You</i> will not misunderstand. Of that I have
no fear. But do not tell the doctor more than
that I am very well, in excellent spirits, and
happier than I have ever been in my life.</p>

<p>No, I have not the smallest objection to
representing rice pudding, or anything else
plain and wholesome, providing I agree with
you, and suffice for the need of the moment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>I am indeed glad to have so good a report.
It proves Deryck right in his diagnosis and
prescription. Keep to the latter faithfully,
in every detail.</p>
<p>I am much interested in your account of
your fellow-guests at the Moorhead Inn. No,
I do not misunderstand your letter; nor do
I credit you with any foolish sentimentality,
or Susie-like flutterings. Jim Airth stands to
you for an abstract thing&mdash;uncompromising
manhood, in its strength and assurance; very
attractive after the loneliness and sense of
being cut adrift, which have been your portion
lately. Only, remember&mdash;where living men
and women are concerned, the safely abstract
is apt suddenly to become the perilously
personal; and your future happiness may be
seriously involved, before you realise the
danger. I confess, I fail to understand the
man&#8217;s avoidance of you. He sounds the sort
of fellow who would be friendly and pleasant
toward all women, and passionately loyal to
one. Perhaps you, with your sweet loveliness&mdash;a
fact, my dear, notwithstanding the observations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
in the Park, of Miss Amelia&#8217;s crony!&mdash;may
remind him of some long-closed page of
past history, and he may shrink from the pain
of a consequent turning of memory&#8217;s leaves.
No doubt Miss Susannah recalls some nice
old maiden-aunt, and he can afford to respond
to her blandishments.</p>
<p>What you say of the way in which Americans
know our standard authors, reminds me of a
fellow-passenger on board the <i>Baltic</i>, on our
outward voyage&mdash;a charming woman, from
Hartford, Connecticut, who sat beside us at
meals. She had been spending five months
in Europe, travelling incessantly, and finished
up with London&mdash;her first visit to our capital&mdash;expecting
to be altogether too tired to enjoy
it; but found it a place of such abounding
interest and delight, that life went on with
fresh zest, and fatigue was forgotten. &#8220;Every
street,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;is so familiar. We
have never seen them before, and yet they
are more familiar than the streets of our native
cities. It is the London of Dickens and of
Thackeray. We know it all. We recognise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
the streets as we come to them. The places
are homelike to us. <i>We have known them all
our lives.</i>&#8221; I enjoyed this tribute to our
English literature. But I wonder, my dear
Myra, how many streets, east of Temple
Bar, in our dear old London, are &#8220;homelike&#8221;
to you!</p>
<p>Garth insists upon sending you at once a
selection of his favourites from among the
works of Dickens. So expect a bulky package
before long. You might read them aloud
to the Miss Murgatroyds, while they knit
and wind wool.</p>
<p>Garth thoroughly enjoyed our trip to
America. You know why we went? Since
he lost his sight, all sounds mean so much to
him. He is so boyishly eager to hear all there
is to be heard in the world. Any possibility
of a new sound-experience fills him with
enthusiastic expectation, and away we go!
He set his heart upon hearing the thunderous
roar of Niagara, so off we went, by the White
Star Line. His enjoyment was complete,
when at last he stood close to the Horseshoe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
Fall, on the Canadian side, with his hand on
the rail at the place where the spray showers
over you, and the great rushing boom seems
all around. And as we stood there together, a
little bird on a twig beside us, began to sing!&mdash;Garth
is putting it all into a symphony.</p>
<p>How true is what you say of the genial
friendliness of Americans! I was thinking it
over, on our homeward voyage. It seems to
me, that, as a rule, they are so far less self-conscious
than we. Their minds are fully at
liberty to go out at once, in keenest appreciation
and interest, to meet a new acquaintance.
Our senseless British greeting: &#8220;How do you
do?&#8221;&mdash;that everlasting question, which neither
expects nor awaits an answer, <i>can</i> only lead
to trite remarks about the weather; whereas
America&#8217;s &#8220;I am happy to meet you, Mrs.
Dalmain,&#8221; or &#8220;I am pleased to make your
acquaintance, Lady Ingleby,&#8221; is an open door,
through which we pass at once to fuller
friendliness. Too often, in the moment of
introduction, the reserved British nature turns
in upon itself, sensitively debating what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
impression it is making; nervously afraid of
being too expansive; fearful of giving itself
away. But, as I said, the American mind
comes forth to meet us with prompt interest
and appreciative expectation; and we make
more friends, in that land of ready sympathies,
in half an hour, than we do in half a year of our
own stiff social functions. Perhaps you will
put me down as biassed in my opinion. Well,
they were wondrous good to Garth and me;
and we depend so greatly upon people <i>saying</i>
exactly the right thing at the right moment.
When friendly looks cannot be seen, tactful
words become more than ever a necessity.</p>
<p>Yes, little Geoff&#8217;s eyes are bright and
shining, and the true golden brown. In
many other ways he is very like his father.</p>
<p>Garth sends his love, and promises you a
special accompaniment to the &#8220;Blackbird&#8217;s
Song,&#8221; such as can easily be played with one
finger!</p>
<p>It seems so strange to address this envelope
to Mrs. O&#8217;Mara. It reminds me of a time
when I dropped my own identity and used
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
another woman&#8217;s name. I only wish your
experiment might end as happily as mine.</p>
<p>Ah, Myra dearest, there is a Best for every
life! Sometimes we can only reach it by a rocky
path or along a thorny way; and those who
fear the pain, come to it not at all. But such
of us as have attained, can testify that it is
worth while. From all you have told me
lately, I gather the Best has not yet come your
way. Keep on expecting. Do not be content
with less.</p>
<p>We certainly must not let Deryck know
that Jim Airth&mdash;what a nice name&mdash;was at
Targai. He would move you on, promptly.</p>
<p>Report again next week; and do abide, if
necessary, beneath the safe chaperonage of
the cameo brooch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>IN HORSESHOE COVE</h3>
</div>

<p>Lady Ingleby sat in the honeysuckle
arbour, pouring her tea from a little
brown earthenware teapot, and spreading
substantial slices of home-made bread with the
creamiest of farm butter, when the aged
postman hobbled up to the garden gate of the
Moorhead Inn, with a letter for Mrs. O&#8217;Mara.</p>
<p>For a moment she could scarcely bring
herself to open an envelope bearing another
name than her own. Then, smiling at her
momentary hesitation, she tore it open with
the keen delight of one, who, accustomed to
a dozen letters a day, has passed a week
without receiving any.</p>
<p>She read Mrs. Dalmain&#8217;s letter through
rapidly; and once she laughed aloud; and once
a sudden colour flamed into her cheeks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>Then she laid it down, and helped herself
to honey&mdash;real heather-honey, golden in the
comb.</p>
<p>She took up her letter again, and read it
carefully, weighing each word.</p>
<p>Then:&mdash;&#8220;Good old Jane!&#8221; she said; &#8220;that
is rather neatly put: the &#8216;safely abstract&#8217;
becoming the &#8216;perilously personal.&#8217; She has
acquired the knack of terse and forceful
phraseology from her long friendship with the
doctor. I can do it myself, when I try; only,
<i>my</i> Sir Derycky sentences are apt merely to
sound well, and mean nothing at all. And&mdash;after
all&mdash;<i>does</i> this of Jane&#8217;s mean anything
worthy of consideration? Could six
foot five of abstraction&mdash;eating its breakfast
in complete unconsciousness of one&#8217;s presence,
returning one&#8217;s timid &#8216;good-morning&#8217; with perfunctory
politeness, and relegating one, while
still debating the possibility of venturing a
remark on the weather, to obvious oblivion&mdash;ever
become perilously personal?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby laughed again, returned the
letter to its envelope, and proceeded to cut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
herself a slice of home-made currant cake.
As she finished it, with a final cup of tea, she
thought with amusement of the difference
between this substantial meal in the honeysuckle
arbour of the old inn garden, and the
fashionable teas then going on in crowded
drawing-rooms in town, where people hurried
in, took a tiny roll of thin bread-and-butter,
and a sip at luke-warm tea, which had stood
sufficiently long to leave an abiding taste of
tannin; heard or imparted a few more or less
detrimental facts concerning mutual friends;
then hurried on elsewhere, to a cucumber
sandwich, colder tea, which had stood even
longer, and a fresh instalment of gossip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, why do we do it?&#8221; mused Lady
Ingleby. Then, taking up her scarlet parasol,
she crossed the little lawn, and stood at the
garden gate, in the afternoon sunlight, debating
in which direction she should go.</p>
<p>Usually her walks took her along the top of
the cliffs, where the larks, springing from the
short turf and clumps of waving harebells,
sang themselves up into the sky. She loved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
being high above the sea, and hearing the
distant thunder of the breakers on the rocks
below.</p>
<p>But to-day the steep little street, down
through the fishing village, to the cove, looked
inviting. The tide was out, and the sands
gleamed golden.</p>
<p>Also, from her seat in the arbour, she had
seen Jim Airth&#8217;s tall figure go swinging along
the cliff edge, silhouetted against the clear
blue of the sky. And one sentence in the
letter she had just received, made this into a
factor which turned her feet toward the shore.</p>
<p>The friendly Cornish folk, sitting on their
doorsteps in the sunshine, smiled at the lovely
woman in white serge, who passed down their
village street, so tall and graceful, beneath
the shade of her scarlet parasol. An item in
the doctor&#8217;s prescription had been the discarding
of widow&#8217;s weeds, and it had seemed
quite natural to Myra to come down to her
first Cornish breakfast in a cream serge gown.</p>
<p>Arrived at the shore, she turned in the
direction she usually took when up above,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
and walked quickly along the firm smooth
sand; pausing occasionally to pick up a
beautifully marked stone, or to examine a
brilliant sea-anemone or gleaming jelly-fish,
left stranded by the tide.</p>
<p>Presently she reached a place where the cliff
jutted out toward the sea; and, climbing over
slippery rocks, studded with shining pools
in which crimson seaweed waved, crabs
scudded sideways from her passing shadow,
and darting shrimps flicked across and buried
themselves hastily in the sand, Myra found
herself in a most fascinating cove. The line
of cliff here made a horseshoe, not quite half a
mile in length. The little bay, within this
curve, was a place of almost fairy-like beauty;
the sand a soft glistening white, decked with
delicate crimson seaweed. The cliffs, towering
up above, gave welcome shadow to the shore;
yet the sun behind them still gleamed and
sparkled on the distant sea.</p>
<p>Myra walked to the centre of the horseshoe;
then, picking up a piece of driftwood, scooped
out a comfortable hollow in the sand, about a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
dozen yards from the foot of the cliff; stuck her
open parasol up behind it, to shield herself from
the observation, from above, of any chance
passer-by; and, settling comfortably into the
soft hollow, lay back, watching, through
half-closed lids, the fleeting shadows, the blue
sky, the gently moving sea. Little white
clouds blushed rosy red. An opal tint gleamed
on the water. The moving ripple seemed too
far away to break the restful silence.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby&#8217;s eyelids drooped lower and
lower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear Jane,&#8221; she murmured,
dreamily watching a snow-white sail, as it
rounded the point, curtseyed, and vanished
from view; &#8220;undoubtedly a&mdash;a well-expressed
sentence; but far from&mdash;from&mdash;being fact.
The safely abstract could hardly require&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a
cameo&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The long walk, the sea breeze, the distant
lapping of the water&mdash;all these combined had
done their soothing work.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby slept peacefully in Horseshoe
Cove; and the rising tide crept in.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>JIM AIRTH TO THE RESCUE</h3>
</div>

<p>An hour later, a man swung along the path
at the summit of the cliffs, whistling like
a blackbird.</p>
<p>The sun was setting; and, as he walked, he
revelled in the gold and crimson of the sky;
in the opal tints upon the heaving sea.</p>
<p>The wind had risen as the sun set, and
breakers were beginning to pound along the
shore.</p>
<p>Suddenly something caught his eye, far
down below.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; he said. &#8220;A scarlet poppy on
the sands!&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked on, until his rapid stride brought
him to the centre of the cliff above Horseshoe
Cove.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>Then&mdash;&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; said Jim Airth,
and stood still.</p>
<p>He had caught sight of Lady Ingleby&#8217;s
white skirt reposing on the sand, beyond the
scarlet parasol.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; said Jim Airth.</p>
<p>Then he scanned the horizon. Not a boat
to be seen.</p>
<p>His quick eye travelled along the cliff, the
way he had come. Not a living thing in sight.</p>
<p>On to the fishing village. Faint threads of
ascending vapour indicated chimneys. &#8220;Two
miles at least,&#8221; muttered Jim Airth. &#8220;I could
not run it and get back with a boat, under
three quarters of an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he looked down into the cove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both ends cut off. The water will reach
her feet in ten minutes; will sweep the base
of the cliff, in twenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly beneath the spot where he stood,
more than half way down, was a ledge about
six feet long by four feet wide.</p>
<p>Letting himself over the edge, holding to
tufts of grass, tiny shrubs, jutting stones,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
cracks in the surface of the sandstone, he
managed to reach this narrow ledge, dropping
the last ten feet, and landing on it by an almost
superhuman effort of balance.</p>
<p>One moment he paused; carefully took its
measure; then, leaning over, looked down.
Sixty feet remained, a precipitous slope, with
nothing to which foot could hold, or hand
could cling.</p>
<p>Jim Airth buttoned his Norfolk jacket, and
tightened his belt. Then slipping, feet foremost
off the ledge, he glissaded down on his
back, bending his knees at the exact moment
when his feet thudded heavily on to the sand.</p>
<p>For a moment the shock stunned him.
Then he got up and looked around.</p>
<p>He stood, within ten yards of the scarlet
parasol, on the small strip of sand still left
uncovered by the rapidly advancing sweep of
the rising tide.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>&#8220;YEO HO, WE GO!&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;A cameo chaperonage,&#8221; murmured Lady
Ingleby, and suddenly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Sky and sea were still there, but between
them, closer than sea or sky, looking down
upon her with a tense light in his blue eyes,
stood Jim Airth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I have been asleep!&#8221; said Lady
Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have,&#8221; said Jim Airth; &#8220;and meanwhile
the sun has set, and&mdash;the tide has come
up. Allow me to assist you to rise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby put her hand into his, and
he helped her to her feet. She stood beside
him gazing, with wide startled eyes, at the
expanse of sea, the rushing waves, the tiny
strip of sand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The tide seems very high,&#8221; said Lady
Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very high,&#8221; agreed Jim Airth. He stood
close beside her, but his eyes still eagerly
scanned the water. If by any chance a boat
came round the point there would still be
time to hail it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We seem to be cut off,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;We <i>are</i> cut off,&#8221; replied Jim Airth, laconically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I suppose we must have a boat,&#8221;
said Lady Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;An excellent suggestion,&#8221; replied Jim
Airth, drily, &#8220;if a boat were to be had. But,
unfortunately, we are two miles from the
hamlet, and this is not a time when boats
pass in and out; nor would they come this
way. When I saw you, from the top of the
cliff, I calculated the chances as to whether I
could reach the boats, and be back here in
time. But, before I could have returned with
a boat, you would have&mdash;been very wet,&#8221;
finished Jim Airth, somewhat lamely.</p>
<p>He looked at the lovely face, close to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
shoulder. It was pale and serious, but showed
no sign of fear.</p>
<p>He glanced at the point of cliff beyond.
Twenty feet above its rocky base the breakers
were dashing; but round that point would be
safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you swim?&#8221; asked Jim Airth, eagerly.</p>
<p>Myra&#8217;s calm grey eyes met his, steadily. A
gleam of amusement dawned in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you put your hand under my chin,
and count &#8216;one&mdash;two! one&mdash;two!&#8217; very loud
and quickly, I can swim nearly ten yards,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>Jim Airth laughed. His eyes met hers, in
sudden comprehending comradeship. &#8220;By
Jove, you&#8217;re plucky!&#8221; they seemed to say.
But what he really said was: &#8220;Then swimming
is no go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No go, for me,&#8221; said Myra, earnestly,
&#8220;nor for you, weighted by me. We should
never get round that eddying whirlpool. It
would merely mean that we should both be
drowned. But you can easily do it alone.
Oh, go at once! Go quickly! And&mdash;don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
look back. I shall be all right. I shall just
sit down against the cliff, and wait. I have
always been fond of the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth looked at her again. And, this
time, open admiration shone in his keen eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, brave!&#8221; he said. &#8220;A mother of
soldiers! Such women make of us a fighting
race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra laid her hand on his sleeve. &#8220;My
friend,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it was never given me to
be a mother. But I am a soldier&#8217;s daughter,
and a soldier&#8217;s widow; and&mdash;I am not afraid
to die. Oh, I do beg of you&mdash;give me one
handclasp and go!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth took the hand held out, but he
kept it firmly in his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not die,&#8221; he said, between his
teeth. &#8220;Do you suppose I would leave any
woman to die alone? And <i>you</i>&mdash;you, of all
women!&mdash;By heaven,&#8221; he repeated, doggedly;
&#8220;you shall not die. Do you think I could go;
and leave&mdash;&#8221; he broke off abruptly.</p>
<p>Myra smiled. His hand was very strong,
and her heart felt strangely restful. And had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
he not said: &#8220;<i>You</i>, of all women?&#8221; But,
even in what seemed likely to be her last
moments, Lady Ingleby&#8217;s unfailing instinct
was to be tactful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you would leave no woman
in danger,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and some, alas! might
have been easier to save than I. Plump little
Miss Susie would have floated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth&#8217;s big laugh rang out. &#8220;And
Miss Murgatroyd could have sailed away in
her cameo,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Then, as if that laugh had broken the spell
which held him inactive: &#8220;Come,&#8221; he cried,
and drew her to the foot of the cliff; &#8220;we have
not a moment to lose! Look! Do you see
the way I came down? See that long slide
in the sand? I tobogganed down there on
my back. Pretty steep, and nothing to hold
to, I admit; but not so very far up, after all.
And, where my slide begins, is a blessed ledge
four foot by six.&#8221; He pulled out a huge
clasp-knife, opened the largest blade, and
commenced hacking steps in the face of the
cliff. &#8220;We must climb,&#8221; said Jim Airth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have never climbed,&#8221; whispered Myra&#8217;s
voice behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must climb to-day,&#8221; said Jim Airth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could never even climb trees,&#8221; whispered
Myra.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must climb a cliff to-night. It is
our only chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hacked on, rapidly.</p>
<p>Suddenly he paused. &#8220;Show me your
reach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mine would not do. Put
your left hand there; so. Now stretch up
with your right; as high as you can, easily....
Ah! three foot six, or thereabouts. Now
your left foot close to the bottom. Step up
with your right, as high as you can comfortably....
Two foot, nine. Good! One
step, more or less, might make all the difference,
by-and-by. Now listen, while I
work. What a God-send for us that there
happens to be, just here, this stratum of soft
sand. We should have been done for, had
the cliff been serpentine marble. You must
choose between two plans. I could scrape
you a step, wider than the rest&mdash;almost a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
ledge&mdash;just out of reach of the water, leaving
you there, while I go on up, and finish.
Then I could return for you. You could
climb in front, I helping from below. You
would feel safer. Or&mdash;you must follow me
up now, step by step, as I cut them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not wait on a ledge alone,&#8221; said
Myra. &#8220;I will follow you, step by step.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Jim Airth; &#8220;it will save time.
I am afraid you must take off your shoes and
stockings. Nothing will do for this work,
but naked feet. We shall need to stick our
toes into the sand, and make them cling on
like fingers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled off his own boots and stockings;
then drew the belt from his Norfolk jacket,
and fastened it firmly round his left ankle in
such a way that a long end would hang down
behind him as he mounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;See that?&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you are in
the niches below me, it will hang close to your
hands. If you are slipping, and feel you <i>must</i>
clutch at something, catch hold of that. Only,
if possible, shout first, and I will stick on like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
a limpet, and try to withstand the strain.
But don&#8217;t do it, unless really necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>He picked up Myra&#8217;s shoes and stockings,
and put them into his big pockets.</p>
<p>At that moment an advance wave rushed up
the sand and caught their bare feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim Airth,&#8221; cried Myra, &#8220;go without
me! I have not a steady head. I cannot
climb.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put his hands upon her shoulders, and
looked full into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>can</i> climb,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You <i>must</i>
climb. You <i>shall</i> climb. We must climb&mdash;or
drown. And, remember: if you fall, I
fall too. You will not be saving me, by
letting yourself go.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up into his eyes, despairingly.
They blazed into hers from beneath his bent
brows. She felt the tremendous mastery of
his will. Her own gave one final struggle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing to live for, Jim Airth,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I am alone in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I have been worse
than alone, for a half score of years. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
there is <i>life</i> to live for. Would you throw
away the highest of all gifts? I want to live&mdash;Good
God! I <i>must</i> live; and so must you. We
live or die together.&#8221;</p>
<p>He loosed her shoulders and took her by
the wrists. He lifted her trembling hands,
and held them against his breast.</p>
<p>For a moment they stood so, in absolute
silence.</p>
<p>Then Myra felt herself completely dominated.
All fear slipped from her; but the
assurance which took its place was his courage,
not hers; and she knew it. Lifting her head,
she smiled at him, with white lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not fall,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Another wave swept round their ankles, and
remained there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Jim Airth, and loosed her
wrists. &#8220;We shall owe our lives to each
other. Next time I look into your face,
please God, we shall be in safety. Come!&#8221;</p>
<p>He sprang up the face of the cliff, standing
in the highest niches he had made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now follow me, carefully,&#8221; he said;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
&#8220;slowly, and carefully. We are not in a position
to hurry. Always keep each hand and
each foot firmly in a niche. Are you there?
Good!... Now don&#8217;t look either up or
down, but keep your eyes on my heels.
Directly I move, come on into the empty
places. See?... Now then. Can you
manage?... Good! On we go! After all
it won&#8217;t take long.... I say, what fun if
the Miss Murgatroyds peeped over the cliff!
Amelia would be so shocked at our bare feet.
Eliza would cry: &#8216;Oh my dear love!&#8217; And
Susie would promptly fall upon us! Hullo!
Steady down there! Don&#8217;t laugh too much....
Fine knife, this. I bought it in Mexico.
And if the big blade gives out, there are two
more; also a saw, and a cork-screw.... Mind
the falling sand does not get into your eyes....
Tell me if the niches are not deep
enough, and remember there is no hurry, we
are not aiming to catch any particular train!
Steady down there! Don&#8217;t laugh.... Up
we go! Oh, good! This is a third of the
way. Don&#8217;t look either up or down. Watch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
my heels&mdash;I wish they were more worth
looking at&mdash;and remember the belt is quite
handy, and I am as firm as a rock up here.
You and all the Miss Murgatroyds might
hang on to it together. Steady down there!...
All right; I won&#8217;t mention them....
By the way, the water must be fairly deep
below us now. If you fell, you would merely
get a ducking. I should slide down and pull
you out, and we would start afresh....
Good Lord!... Oh, never mind! Nothing.
Only, my knife slipped, but I caught it again....
We must be half way, by now. How
lucky we have my glissading marks to guide
us. I can&#8217;t see the ledge from here. Let&#8217;s
sing &#8216;Nancy Lee.&#8217; I suppose you know it. I
can always work better to a good rollicking
tune.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as he drove his blade into the cliff,
Jim Airth&#8217;s gay voice rang out:</p>

<p>came Lady Ingleby&#8217;s voice from below,
rather faint and quavering.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; shouted Jim Airth. &#8220;Keep
it up! I can see the ledge now, just above
us.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>quavered Lady Ingleby, making one final
effort to move up into the vacant niches,
though conscious that her fingers and toes
were so numb that she could not feel them
grip the sand.</p>
<p>Then Jim Airth&#8217;s whole body vanished
suddenly from above her, as he drew himself
on to the ledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Yeo ho! we go</i>!&#8221; Came his gay voice
from above.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'><i>&#8220;Yeo ho! Yeo ho!&#8221;</i></p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>sang Lady Ingleby, in a faint whisper.</p>
<p>She could not move on into the empty
niches. She could only remain where she
was, clinging to the face of the cliff.</p>
<p>She suddenly thought of a fly on a wall;
and remembered a particular fly, years ago,
on her nursery wall. She had followed its
ascent with a small interested finger, and her
nurse had come by with a duster, and saying:
&#8220;Nasty thing!&#8221; had ruthlessly flicked it off.
The fly had fallen&mdash;fallen dead, on the
nursery carpet.... Lady Ingleby felt she
too was falling. She gave one agonised glance
upward to the towering cliff, with the line of
sky above it. Then everything swayed and
rocked. &#8220;A mother of soldiers,&#8221; her brain
insisted, &#8220;must fall without screaming.&#8221; Then&mdash;A
long arm shot down from above; a
strong hand gripped her firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;One step more,&#8221; said Jim Airth&#8217;s voice,
close to her ear, &#8220;and I can lift you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made the effort, and he drew her on to
the ledge beside him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby.
&#8220;And who was Davy Jones?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth&#8217;s face was streaming with perspiration.
His mouth was full of sand. His
heart was beating in his throat. But he loved
to play the game, and he loved to see another
do it. So he laughed as he put his arm around
her, holding her tightly so that she should not
realise how much she was trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Davy Jones,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is a gentleman
who has a locker at the bottom of the sea, into
which all drown&#8217;d things go. I am afraid
your pretty parasol has gone there, and my
boots and stockings. But we may well spare
him those.... Oh, I say!.... Yes, do
have a good cry. Don&#8217;t mind me. And
don&#8217;t you think between us we could remember
some sort of a prayer? For if ever two people
faced death together, we have faced it; and,
by God&#8217;s mercy, here we are&mdash;alive.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>&#8217;TWIXT SEA AND SKY</h3>
</div>

<p>Myra never forgot Jim Airth&#8217;s prayer.
Instinctively she knew it to be the first
time he had voiced his soul&#8217;s thanksgiving or
petitions in the presence of another. Also
she realised that, for the first time in her whole
life, prayer became to her a reality. As she
crouched on the ledge beside him, shaking
uncontrollably, so that, but for his arm about
her, she must have lost her balance and fallen;
as she heard that strong soul expressing in
simple unorthodox language its gratitude for
life and safety, mingled with earnest petition
for keeping through the night and complete
deliverance in the morning; it seemed to
Myra that the heavens opened, and the felt
presence of God surrounded them in their
strange isolation.</p>
<p>An immense peace filled her. By the time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
those disjointed halting sentences were finished,
Myra had ceased trembling; and when Jim
Airth, suddenly at a loss how else to wind up
his prayer, commenced &#8220;Our Father, Who art
in heaven,&#8221; Myra&#8217;s sweet voice united with
his, full of an earnest fervour of petition.</p>
<p>At the final words, Jim Airth withdrew his
arm, and a shy silence fell between them.
The emotion of the mind had awakened an
awkwardness of body. In that uniting &#8220;<i>Our</i>
Father,&#8221; their souls had leapt on, beyond
where their bodies were quite prepared to
follow.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby saved the situation. She
turned to Jim Airth, with that impulsive
sweetness which could never be withstood.
In the rapidly deepening twilight, he could
just see the large wistful grey eyes, in the
white oval of her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I really couldn&#8217;t
possibly sit all night, on a ledge the size of a
Chesterfield sofa, with a person I had to call
&#8216;Mr.&#8217; I could only sit there with an old and
intimate friend, who would naturally call me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
&#8216;Myra,&#8217; and whom I might call &#8216;Jim.&#8217; Unless
I may call you &#8216;Jim,&#8217; I shall insist on climbing
down and swimming home. And if you
address me as &#8216;Mrs. O&#8217;Mara,&#8217; I shall certainly
become hysterical, and tumble off!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why of course,&#8221; said Jim Airth. &#8220;I hate
titles of any kind. I come of an old Quaker
stock, and plain names with no prefixes
always seem best to me. And are we not old
and trusted friends? Was not each of those
minutes on the face of the cliff, a year? While
that second which elapsed between the slipping
of my knife from my right hand and the
catching of it, against my knee, by my left,
may go at ten years! Ah, think if it had
dropped altogether! No, don&#8217;t think. We
were barely half way up. Now you must
contrive to put on your shoes and stockings.&#8221;
He produced them from his pocket. &#8220;And
then we must find out how to place ourselves
most comfortably and safely. We have but
one enemy to fight during the next seven
hours&mdash;cramp. You must tell me immediately
if you feel it threatening anywhere, I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
done a lot of scouting in my time, and know
a dodge or two. I also know what it is to
lie in one position for hours, not daring to
move a muscle, the cold sweat pouring off my
face, simply from the agonies of cramp. We
must guard against that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Myra, &#8220;how long shall we have
to sit here?&#8221;</p>
<p>He made a quick movement, as if the sound
of his name from her lips for the first time,
meant much to him; and there was in his voice
an added depth of joyousness, as he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be impossible to climb from here
to the top of the cliff. When I came down, I
had a sheer drop of ten feet. You see the
cliff slightly overhangs just above us. So far
as the tide is concerned we might clamber
down in three hours; but there is no moon,
and by then, it will be pitch dark. We must
have light for our descent, if I am to land you
safe and unshaken at the bottom. Dawn
should be breaking soon after three. The sun
rises to-morrow at 3.44; but it will be quite
light before then. I think we may expect to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
reach the Moorhead Inn by 4 A.M. Let us
hope Miss Murgatroyd will not be looking out
of her window, as we stroll up the path.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they all thinking now?&#8221; questioned
Lady Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, and I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Jim
Airth, gaily. &#8220;You&#8217;re alive, and I&#8217;m alive;
and we&#8217;ve done a record climb! Nothing else
matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but seriously, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, seriously, it is very unlikely that I
shall be missed at all. I often dine elsewhere,
and let myself in quite late; or stop out
altogether. How about you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, curiously enough,&#8221; said Myra, &#8220;before
coming out I locked my bedroom door.
I have the key here. I had left some papers
lying about&mdash;I am not a very tidy person.
On the only other occasion upon which I
locked my door, I omitted dinner altogether,
and went to bed on returning from my evening
walk. I am supposed to be doing a &#8216;rest-cure&#8217;
here. The maid tried my door, went
away, and did not turn up again until next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
morning. Most likely she has done the same
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t suppose they will send out a
search-party,&#8221; said Jim Airth.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. We are so alone down here. We
only matter to ourselves,&#8221; said Myra.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to each other,&#8221; said Jim Airth,
quietly.</p>
<p>Myra&#8217;s heart stood still.</p>
<p>Those four words, spoken so simply by that
deep tender voice, meant more to her than
any words had ever meant. They meant so
much, that they made for themselves a silence&mdash;a
vast holy temple of wonder and realisation
wherein they echoed back and forth,
repeating themselves again and again.</p>
<p>The two on the ledge sat listening.</p>
<p>The chant of mutual possession, so suddenly
set going, was too beautiful a thing to
be interrupted by other words.</p>
<p>Even Lady Ingleby&#8217;s unfailing habit of
tactful speech was not allowed to spoil the
deep sweetness of this unexpected situation.
Myra&#8217;s heart was waking; and when the heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
is stirred, the mind sometimes forgets to be
tactful.</p>
<p>At length:&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember,&#8221; he said,
very low, &#8220;what I told you before we began
to climb? Did I not say, that if we succeeded
in reaching the ledge safely, we should owe
our lives to each other? Well, we did; and&mdash;we
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no,&#8221; cried Myra, impulsively. &#8220;No,
Jim Airth! You&mdash;glad, and safe, and free&mdash;were
walking along the top of these cliffs. I,
in my senseless folly, lay sleeping on the sand
below, while the tide rose around me. You
came down into danger to save me, risking
your life in so doing. I owe you my life, Jim
Airth; you owe me nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man beside her turned and looked at
her, with his quiet whimsical smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not accustomed to have my statements
amended,&#8221; he said, drily.</p>
<p>It was growing so dark, they could only
just discern each other&#8217;s faces.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby laughed. She was so unused
to that kind of remark, that, at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
the moment she could frame no suitable
reply.</p>
<p>Presently:&mdash;&#8220;I suppose I really owe my
life to my scarlet parasol,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Had
it not attracted your attention, you would not
have seen me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I not?&#8221; questioned Jim Airth, his
eyes on the white loveliness of her face.
&#8220;Since I saw you first, on the afternoon of
your arrival, have you ever once come within
my range of vision without my seeing you,
and taking in every detail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the afternoon of my arrival?&#8221; questioned
Lady Ingleby, astonished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Jim Airth, deliberately.
&#8220;Seven o&#8217;clock, on the first of June. I stood
at the smoking-room window, at a loose end of
all things; sick of myself, dissatisfied with my
manuscript, tired of fried fish&mdash;don&#8217;t laugh;
small things, as well as great, go to make up
the sum of a man&#8217;s depression. Then the
gate swung back, and YOU&mdash;in golden capitals&mdash;the
sunlight in your eyes, came up the
garden path. I judged you to be a woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
grown, in years perhaps not far short of my
own age; I guessed you a woman of the world,
with a position to fill, and a knowledge of men
and things. Yet you looked just a lovely
child, stepping into fairy-land; the joyful
surprise of unexpected holiday danced in your
radiant eyes. Since then, the beautiful side
of life has always been you&mdash;YOU, in golden
capitals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth paused, and sat silent.</p>
<p>It was quite dark now.</p>
<p>Myra slipped her hand into his, which
closed upon it with a strong unhesitating
clasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Jim,&#8221; she said, softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went out into the hall, and saw your
name in the visitors&#8217; book. The ink was still
wet. The handwriting was that of the
holiday-child&mdash;I should like to set you copies!
The name surprised me&mdash;agreeably. I had
expected to be able at once to place the
woman who had walked up the path. It was
a surprise and a relief to find that my Fairy-land
Princess was not after all a fashionable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
beauty or a society leader, but owned just a
simple Irish name, and lived at a Lodge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Jim,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby, rather
tremulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the name &#8216;Shenstone&#8217; interested me,
because I know the Inglebys&mdash;at least, I
knew Lord Ingleby, well; and I shall soon
know Lady Ingleby. In fact I have written
to-day asking for an interview. I must see
her on business connected with notes of her
husband&#8217;s which, if she gives permission, are
to be embodied in my book. I suppose if you
live near Shenstone Park you know the
Inglebys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Myra. &#8220;But tell me, Jim;
if&mdash;if you noticed so much that first day;
if you were&mdash;interested; if you wanted to set
me copies&mdash;yes, I know I write a shocking
hand;&mdash;why would you never look at me?
Why were you so stiff and unfriendly? Why
were you not as nice to me as you were to
Susie, for instance?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth sat long in silence, staring out into
the darkness. At last he said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want to tell you. Of course, I <i>must</i> tell
you. But&mdash;may I ask a few questions first?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby also gazed unseeingly into the
darkness; but she leaned a little nearer to the
broad shoulder beside her. &#8220;Ask me what
you will,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is nothing, in my
whole life, I would not tell you, Jim Airth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her cheek was so close to the rough
Norfolk jacket, that if it had moved a shade
nearer, she would have rested against it.
But it did not move; only, the clasp on her
hand tightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you married very young?&#8221; asked
Jim Airth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not quite eighteen. It is ten years
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you marry for love?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long silence, while both looked
steadily into the darkness.</p>
<p>Then Myra answered, speaking very slowly.
&#8220;To be quite honest, I think I married chiefly
to escape from a very unhappy home. Also
I was very young, and knew nothing&mdash;nothing
of life, and nothing of love; and&mdash;how can I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
explain, Jim Airth?&mdash;I have not learnt much
during these ten long years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been unhappy?&#8221; He asked the
question very low.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly unhappy. My husband was
a very good man; kind and patient, beyond
words, towards me. But I often vaguely
felt I was missing the Best in life. Now&mdash;I
know I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been&mdash;How long has
he been dead?&#8221; The deep voice was so
tender, that the question could bring no pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven months,&#8221; replied Lady Ingleby.
&#8220;My husband was killed in the assault on
Targai.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At Targai!&#8221; exclaimed Jim Airth, surprised
into betraying his astonishment. Then
at once recovering himself: &#8220;Ah, yes; of course.
Seven months. I was there, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, within himself, he was thinking rapidly,
and much was becoming clear.</p>
<p>Sergeant O&#8217;Mara! Was it possible? An
exquisite refined woman such as this, bearing
about her the unmistakable hall-mark of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
high birth and perfect breeding? The Sergeant
was a fine fellow, and superior&mdash;but, good
Lord! <i>Her</i> husband! Yet girls of eighteen
do foolish things, and repent ever after. A
runaway match from an unhappy home; then
cast off by her relations, and now left friendless
and alone. But&mdash;Sergeant O&#8217;Mara! Yet
no other O&#8217;Mara fell at Targai; and there
<i>was</i> some link between him and Lord Ingleby.</p>
<p>Then, into his musing, came Myra&#8217;s soft
voice, from close beside him, in the darkness:
&#8220;My husband was always good to me;
but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jim Airth laid his other hand over the
one he held. &#8220;I am sure he was,&#8221; he said,
gently. &#8220;But if you had been older, and had
known more of love and life you would have
done differently. Don&#8217;t try to explain. I
understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Myra gladly left it at that. It would
have been so very difficult to explain further,
without explaining Michael; and all that really
mattered was, that&mdash;with or without explanation&mdash;Jim
Airth understood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And now&mdash;tell me,&#8221; she suggested, softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; he said, pulling himself together,
with an effort. &#8220;My experience also misses
the Best, and likewise covers ten long years.
But it is a harder one than yours. I married,
when a boy of twenty-one, a woman, older
than myself; supremely beautiful. I went
mad over her loveliness. Nothing seemed to
count or matter, but that. I knew she was
not a good woman, but I thought she might
become so; and even if she didn&#8217;t it made no
difference. I wanted her. Afterwards I
found she had laughed at me, all the time.
Also, there had all the time been another&mdash;an
older man than I&mdash;who had laughed with
her. He had not been in a position to marry
her when I did; but two years later, he came
into money. Then&mdash;she left me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth paused. His voice was hard
with pain. The night was very black. In
the dark silence they could hear the rhythmic
thunder of the waves pounding monotonously
against the cliff below.</p>
<p>&#8220;I divorced her, of course; and he married
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
her; but I went abroad, and stayed abroad.
I never could look upon her as other than my
wife. She had made a hell of my life; robbed
me of every illusion; wrecked my ideals;
imbittered my youth. But I had said, before
God, that I took her for my wife, until death
parted us; and, so long as we were both alive,
what power could free me from that solemn
oath? It seemed to me that by remaining
in another hemisphere, I made her second
marriage less sinful. Often, at first, I was
tempted to shoot myself, as a means of righting
this other wrong. But in time I outgrew
that morbidness, and realised that though
Love is good, Life is the greatest gift of all.
To throw it away, voluntarily, is an unpardonable
sin. The suicide&#8217;s punishment
should be loss of immortality. Well, I found
work to do, of all sorts, in America, and elsewhere.
And a year ago&mdash;she died. I should
have come straight home, only I was booked
for that muddle on the frontier they called &#8216;a
war.&#8217; I got fever after Targai; was invalided
home; and here I am recruiting and finishing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
my book. Now you can understand why
loveliness in a woman, fills me with a sort of panic,
even while a part of me still leaps up
instinctively to worship it. I had often said
to myself that if I ever ventured upon matrimony
again, it should be a plain face, and a
noble heart; though all the while I knew I
should never bring myself really to want the
plain face. And yet, just as the burnt child
dreads the fire, I have always tried to look
away from beauty. Only&mdash;my Fairy-land
Princess, may I say it?&mdash;days ago I began to
feel certain that in you&mdash;YOU in golden
capitals&mdash;the loveliness and the noble heart
went together. But from the moment when,
stepping out of the sunset, you walked up the
garden path, right into my heart, the fact of
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>YOU</span>, just being what you are, and being here,
meant so much to me, that I did not dare let
it mean more. Somehow I never connected
you with widowhood; and not until you said
this evening on the shore: &#8216;I am a soldier&#8217;s
widow,&#8217; did I know that you were free.&mdash;There!
Now you have heard all there is to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
hear. I made a bad mistake at the beginning;
but I hope I am not the sort of chap you
need mind sitting on a ledge with, and
calling &#8216;Jim&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer, Myra&#8217;s cheek came trustfully
to rest against the sleeve of the rough tweed
coat. &#8220;Jim,&#8221; she said; &#8220;Oh, Jim!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Presently: &#8220;So you know the Inglebys?&#8221;
remarked Jim Airth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Myra.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is &#8216;The Lodge&#8217; near Shenstone Park?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lodge is <i>in</i> the park. It is not at any
of the gates.&mdash;I am not a gate-keeper, Jim!&mdash;It
is a pretty little house, standing by itself,
just inside the north entrance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you rent it from them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra hesitated, but only for the fraction
of a second. &#8220;No; it is my own. Lord
Ingleby gave it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Lord</i> Ingleby?&#8221; Jim Airth&#8217;s voice sounded
like knitted brows. &#8220;Why not <i>Lady</i> Ingleby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not hers, to give. All that is hers,
was his.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Which of them did you know first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have known Lady Ingleby all my life,&#8221;
said Myra, truthfully; &#8220;and I have known
Lord Ingleby since his marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. Then he became your friend, because
he married her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra laughed. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I suppose
so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that it struck me as an amusing way
of putting it; but it is undoubtedly true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they any children?&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra&#8217;s voice shook slightly. &#8220;No, none.
Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in the campaign, I often shared
Lord Ingleby&#8217;s tent; and he used to talk in his
sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was one name he often called and
repeated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby&#8217;s heart stood still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she said, hardly breathing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was &#8216;Peter&#8217;,&#8221; continued Jim Airth.
&#8220;The night before he was killed, he kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
turning in his sleep and saying: &#8216;Peter! Hullo,
little Peter! Come here!&#8217; I thought perhaps
he had a little son named Peter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had no son,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby,
controlling her voice with effort. &#8220;Peter
was a dog of which he was very fond. Was
that the only name he spoke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The only one I ever heard,&#8221; replied Jim
Airth.</p>
<p>Then suddenly Lady Ingleby clasped both
hands round his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she whispered, brokenly, &#8220;Not once
have you spoken my name. It was a bargain.
We were to be old and intimate friends. I
seem to have been calling you &#8216;Jim&#8217; all my
life! But you have not yet called me &#8216;Myra,&#8217;
Let me hear it now, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth laid his big hand over both of
hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hush! I can&#8217;t. Not
up here&mdash;it means too much. Wait until we
get back to earth again. Then&mdash;Oh, I say!
Can&#8217;t you help?&#8221;</p>
<p>This kind of emotion was an unknown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
quantity to Lady Ingleby. So was the wild
beating of her own heart. But she knew the
situation called for tact, and was not tactful
speech always her special forte?</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she said, &#8220;are you not frightfully
hungry? I should be; only I had an enormous
tea before coming out. Would you
like to hear what I had for tea? No. I am
afraid it would make you feel worse. I suppose
dinner at the inn was over, long ago.
I wonder what variation of fried fish they had,
and whether Miss Susannah choked over a
fish-bone, and had to be requested to leave
the room. Oh, do you remember that evening?
You looked so dismayed and alarmed, I quite
thought you were going to the rescue! I
wonder what time it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can soon tell that,&#8221; said Jim Airth,
cheerfully. He dived into his pocket, produced
a matchbox which he had long been
fingering turn about with his pipe and tobacco-pouch,
struck a light, and looked at his watch.
Myra saw the lean brown face, in the weird
flare of the match. She also saw the horrid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
depth so close to them, which she had almost
forgotten. A sense of dizziness came over
her. She longed to cling to his arm; but
he had drawn it resolutely away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Half past ten,&#8221; said Jim Airth. &#8220;Miss
Murgatroyd has donned her night-cap. Miss
Eliza has sighed: &#8216;<i>Good-night, summer, good-night,
good-night</i>,&#8217; at her open lattice; and
Susie, folding her plump hands, has said:
&#8216;<i>Now I lay me</i>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra laughed. &#8220;And they will all be
listening for you to dump out your big boots,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;That is always your &#8216;Good-night&#8217;
to the otherwise silent house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, really? Does it make a noise?&#8221; said
Jim Airth, ruefully. &#8220;Never again&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you must,&#8221; said Myra. &#8220;I love&mdash;I
mean <i>Susie</i> loves the sound, and listens
for it. Jim, that match reminds me:&mdash;why
don&#8217;t you smoke? Surely it would
help the hunger, and be comfortable and
cheering.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth&#8217;s pipe and pouch were out in a
twinkling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you don&#8217;t mind? It doesn&#8217;t make
you sick, or give you a headache?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think I like it,&#8221; said Myra. &#8220;In
fact, I am sure I like it. That is, I like to
sit beside it. No, I don&#8217;t do it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another match flared, and again she saw the
chasm, and the nearness of the edge. She
bore it until the pipe was drawing well. Then:
&#8220;Oh, Jim,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am so sorry; but I
am afraid I am becoming dizzy. I feel as
though I must fall over.&#8221; She gave a half sob.</p>
<p>Jim Airth turned, instantly alert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; he said, but the sharp word
sounded tender. &#8220;Four good feet of width are
as safe as forty. Change your position a bit.&#8221;
He put his arm around her, and moved her so
that she leant more completely against the
cliff at their backs. &#8220;Now forget the edge,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and listen. I am going to tell you
camp yarns, and tales of the Wild West.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then as they sat on in the darkness, Jim
Airth smoked and talked, painting vivid
word-pictures of life and adventure in other
lands. And Myra listened, absorbed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
enchanted; every moment realising more fully,
as he unconsciously revealed it, the manly
strength and honest simplicity of his big
nature, with its fun and its fire; its huge
capacity for enjoyment; its corresponding
capacity for pain.</p>
<p>And, as she listened, her heart said: &#8220;Oh,
my cosmopolitan cowboy! Thank God you
found no title in the book, to put you off.
Thank God you found no name which you
could &#8216;place,&#8217; relegating its poor possessor to
the ranks of &#8216;society leaders&#8217; in which you
would have had no share. And, oh! most
of all, I thank God for the doctor&#8217;s wise
injunction: &#8216;Leave behind you your own
identity&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>UNDER THE MORNING STAR</h3>
</div>

<p>The night wore on.</p>
<p>Stars shone in the deep purple sky;
bright watchful eyes looking down unwearied
upon the sleeping world.</p>
<p>The sound of the sea below fell from a roar
to a murmur, and drew away into the distance.</p>
<p>It was a warm June night, and very still.</p>
<p>Jim Airth had moved along the ledge to the
further end, and sat swinging his legs over the
edge. His content was so deep and full, that
ordinary speech seemed impossible; and silence,
a glad necessity. The prospect of that which
the future might hold in store, made the ledge
too narrow to contain him. He sought relief
in motion, and swung his long legs out into the
darkness.</p>
<p>It had not occurred to him to wonder at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
companion&#8217;s silence; the reason for his own
had been so all-sufficient.</p>
<p>At length he struck a match to see the time;
then, turning with a smile, held it so that its
light illumined Myra.</p>
<p>She knelt upon the ledge, her hands pressed
against the overhanging cliff, her head turned
in terror away from it. Her face was ashen in
its whiteness, and large tears rolled down her
cheeks.</p>
<p>Jim dropped the match, with an exclamation,
and groped towards her in the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;Oh, my dear, what is
the matter? Selfish fool, that I am! I
thought you were just resting, quiet and
content.&#8221;</p>
<p>His groping hands found and held her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim,&#8221; sobbed Lady Ingleby, &#8220;I am
so sorry! It is so weak and unworthy. But
I am afraid I feel faint. The whole cliff
seems to rock and move. Every moment I
fear it will tip me over. And you seemed
miles away!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> faint,&#8221; said Jim Airth; &#8220;and no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
wonder. There is nothing weak or unworthy
about it. You have been quite splendid. It
is I who have been a thoughtless ass. But I
can&#8217;t have you fainting up here. You must
lie down at once. If I sit on the edge with
my back to you, can you slip along behind me
and lie at full length, leaning against the
cliff?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, oh no, I couldn&#8217;t!&#8221; whispered Myra.
&#8220;It frightens me so horribly when you hang
your legs over the edge, and I can&#8217;t bear to
touch the cliff. It seems worse than the black
emptiness. It rocks to and fro, and seems to
push me over. Oh, Jim! What shall I do?
Help me, help me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>must</i> lie down,&#8221; said Jim Airth,
between his teeth. &#8220;Here, wait a minute.
Move out a little way. Don&#8217;t be afraid.
I have hold of you. Let me get behind
you.... That&#8217;s right. Now you are not
touching the cliff. Let me get my shoulders
firmly into the hollow at this end, and my
feet fixed at the other. There! With my
back rammed into it like this, nothing short
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
of an earthquake could dislodge me. Now
dear&mdash;turn your back to me and your face
to the sea and let yourself go. You will not
fall over. Do not be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very gently, but very firmly, he drew her
into his arms.</p>
<p>Tired, frightened, faint,&mdash;Lady Ingleby
was conscious at first of nothing save the
intense relief of the sense of his great strength
about her. She seemed to have been fighting
the cliff and resisting the gaping darkness,
until she was utterly worn out. Now she
yielded to his gentle insistence, and sank
into safety. Her cheek rested against his
rough coat, and it seemed to her more soothing
than the softest pillow. With a sigh of content,
she folded her hands upon her breast,
and he laid one of his big ones firmly
over them both. She felt so safe, and
held.</p>
<p>Then she heard Jim Airth&#8217;s voice, close to
her ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not alone,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You must
try to sleep, dear; but first I want you to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
realise that we are not alone. Do you know
what I mean? <i>God is here.</i> When I was a
very little chap, I used to go to a Dame-school
in the Highlands; and the old dame made me
learn by heart the hundred and thirty-ninth
psalm. I have repeated parts of it in all sorts
of places of difficulty and danger. I am going
to say my favourite verses to you now.
Listen. &#8216;Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit?
or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?...
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell
in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there
shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand
shall hold me. If I say, Surely the darkness
shall cover me; even the night shall be light
about me. Yea, the darkness hideth not from
Thee; but the night shineth as the day: the
darkness and the light are both alike to Thee.... How
precious also are Thy thoughts
unto me, O God! how great is the sum of
them. If I should count them they are more
in number than the sand: when I awake I am
still with Thee.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The deep voice ceased. Lady Ingleby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
opened her eyes. &#8220;I was nearly asleep,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;How good you are, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am not good,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m
a tough chap, full of faults, and beset by
failings. Only&mdash;if you will trust me, please
God, I will never fail you. But now I want
you to sleep; and I don&#8217;t want you to think
about me. I am merely a thing, which by
God&#8217;s providence is allowed to keep you in
safety. Do you see that wonderful planet,
hanging like a lamp in the sky? Watch it,
while I tell you some lines written by an
American woman, on the thought of that last
verse.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with his cheek against her soft hair, and
his strong arms firmly round her, Jim Airth
repeated, slowly, Mrs. Beecher Stowe&#8217;s matchless
poem:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Alone with Thee, in breathless adoration,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Sweet the repose, beneath Thy wings o&#8217;ershadowing,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Jim Airth&#8217;s voice ceased. He waited a
moment in silence.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;&#8220;Do you like it?&#8221; he asked softly.</p>
<p>There was no answer. Myra slept as
peacefully as a little child. He could feel the
regular motion of her quiet breathing, beneath
his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; said Jim Airth, with his
eyes on the morning star.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE AWAKENING</h3>
</div>

<p>When Lady Ingleby opened her eyes, she
could not, for a moment, imagine where
she was.</p>
<p>Dawn was breaking over the sea. A rift
of silver, in the purple sky, had taken the
place of the morning star. She could see the
silvery gleam reflected in the ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why am I sleeping so close to a large
window?&#8221; queried her bewildered mind. &#8220;Or
am I on a balcony?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do I feel so extraordinarily strong
and rested?&#8221; questioned her slowly awakening
body.</p>
<p>She lay quite still and considered the matter.</p>
<p>Then looking down, she saw a large brown
hand clasping both hers. Her head was
resting in the curve of the arm to which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
hand belonged. A strong right arm was
flung over and around her. All questionings
were solved by two short words: &#8220;Jim Airth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby lay very still. She feared to
break the deep spell of restfulness which held
her. She hesitated to bring down to earth the
exquisite sense of heaven, by which she was
surrounded.</p>
<p>As the dawn broke over the sea, a wonderful
light dawned in her eyes, a radiance such as
had never shone in those sweet eyes before.
&#8220;Dear God,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;am I to know
the Best?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she gently withdrew one hand, and
laid it on the hand which had covered both.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Jim! Look! It is day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; came Jim Airth&#8217;s voice from behind
her. &#8220;Yes? <i>What?</i> <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>come in</span>!&mdash;Hullo! Oh, I
say!&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra smiled into the dawning. She had
already come through those first moments
of astonished realisation. But Jim Airth
awoke to the situation more quickly than she
had done.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I meant to keep watch
all the time; but I must have slept. Are you
all right? Sure? No cramp? Well, I have a
cramp in my left leg which will make me kick
down the cliff in another minute, if I don&#8217;t
move it. Let me help you up.... That&#8217;s
the way. Now you sit safely there, while I
get unwedged.... By Jove! I believe I&#8217;ve
grown into the cliff, like a fossil ichthyosaurus.
Did you ever see an ichthyosaurus? Doesn&#8217;t
it seem years since you said: &#8216;And who is Davy
Jones?&#8217; Don&#8217;t you want some breakfast?
I suppose it&#8217;s about time we went home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Talking gaily all the time, Jim Airth drew
up his long limbs, rubbing them vigorously;
stretched his arms above his head; then passed
his hand over his tumbled hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;My wig!&#8221; he said. &#8220;What a morning!
And how good to be alive!&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra stole a look at him. His eyes were
turned seaward. The same dawn-light was
in them, as shone in her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want breakfast?&#8221; said Jim
Airth, and pulled out his watch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Myra, gaily. &#8220;And now I
can venture to tell you what delicious home-made
bread I had for tea. What time is it,
Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Half past three. In a few minutes the
sun will rise. Watch! Did you ever before
see the dawn? Is it not wonderful? Always
more of pearl and silver than at sunset. Look
how the narrow rift has widened and spread
right across the sky. The Monarch of Day is
coming! See the little herald clouds, in livery
of pink and gold. Now watch where the sea
looks brightest. Ah!... There is the tip
of his blood-red rim, rising out of the ocean.
And how quickly the whole ball appears.
Now see the rippling path of gold and
crimson, a royal highway on the waters,
right from the shore below us, to the
footstool of his brilliant Majesty.... A
new day has begun; and we have not said
&#8216;Good-morning.&#8217; Why should we? We did
not say &#8216;Good-night.&#8217; How ideal it would be,
never to say &#8216;Good-morning&#8217;; and never to say
&#8216;Good-night.&#8217; The night would be always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
&#8216;good&#8217;, and so would the morning. All life
would be one grand crescendo of good&mdash;better&mdash;best.
What? Have we found the
Best? Ah, hush! I did not mean to say that
yet.... Are you ready for the climb
down? No, I can&#8217;t allow any peeping over,
and considering. If you really feel afraid
of it, I will run to Tregarth as quickly as
possible, rouse the sleeping village, bring ropes
and men, and haul you up from the top.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I absolutely decline to be &#8216;hauled up from
the top,&#8217; or to be left here alone,&#8221; declared
Lady Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the sooner we start down, the better,&#8221;
said Jim Airth. &#8220;I&#8217;m going first.&#8221; He was
over the edge before Myra could open her lips
to expostulate. &#8220;Now turn round. Hold on
to the ledge firmly with your hands, and give
me your feet. Do you hear? Do as I tell
you. Don&#8217;t hesitate. It is less steep than
it seemed yesterday. We are quite safe.
Come on!... That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Lady Ingleby passed through a most
terrifying five minutes, while she yielded in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
blind obedience to the strong hands beneath
her, and the big voice which encouraged and
threatened alternately.</p>
<p>But when the descent was over and she
stood on the shore beside Jim Airth; when
together they turned and looked in silence up
the path of glory on the rippling waters, to
the blazing beauty of the rising sun, thankful
tears rushed to Lady Ingleby&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;God is good!
It is so wonderful to be alive!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Jim Airth turned, his face transfigured,
the sunlight in his eyes, and opened his arms.
&#8220;Myra,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have found the
Best.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>They walked along the shore, and up the
steep street of the sleeping village, hand in
hand like happy children.</p>
<p>Arrived at the Moorhead Inn, they pushed
open the garden gate, and stepped noiselessly
across the sunlit lawn.</p>
<p>The front door was firmly bolted. Jim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
Airth slipped round to the back, but returned
in a minute shaking his head. Then
he felt in his pocket for the big knife
which had served them so well; pushed back
the catch of the coffee-room window; softly
raised the sash; swung one leg over, and
drew Myra in after him.</p>
<p>Once in the familiar room, with its mustard-pots
and salt-cellars, its table-cloths, left on
in readiness for breakfast, they both lapsed
into fits of uncontrollable laughter; laughter
the more overwhelming, because it had to be
silent.</p>
<p>Jim, recovering first, went off to the larder
to forage for food.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby flew noiselessly up to her
room to wash her hands, and smooth her hair.
She returned in two minutes to find Jim,
very proud of his success, setting out a crusty
home-made loaf, a large cheese, and a foaming
tankard of ale.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby longed for tea, and had never
in her life drunk ale out of a pewter pot.
But not for worlds would she have spoiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
Jim Airth&#8217;s boyish delight in the success of
his raid on the larder.</p>
<p>So they sat at the centre table, Myra in
Miss Murgatroyd&#8217;s place, and Jim in Susie&#8217;s,
and consumed their bread-and-cheese, and
drank their beer, with huge appetites and
prodigious enjoyment. And Jim used Miss
Susannah&#8217;s napkin, and pretended to be
sentimental over it. And Myra reproved him,
after the manner of Miss Murgatroyd reproving
Susie. After which they simultaneously
exclaimed: &#8220;Oh, my dear love!&#8221; in Miss
Eliza&#8217;s most affecting manner; then linked
fingers for a wish, and could neither of them
think of one.</p>
<p>By the time they had finished, and cleared
away, it was half past five. They passed into
the hall together.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must get some more sleep,&#8221; said Jim
Airth, authoritatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, if you wish it,&#8221; whispered Myra;
&#8220;but I never, in my whole life, felt so strong
or so rested. Jim, I shall sit at your table,
and pour out your coffee at breakfast. Let&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
aim to have it at nine, as usual. It will be
such fun to watch the Murgatroyds, and to
remember our cheese and beer. If you are
down first, order our breakfasts at the same
table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jim Airth.</p>
<p>Myra commenced mounting the stairs,
but turned on the fifth step and hung over the
banisters to smile at him.</p>
<p>Jim Airth reached up his hand. &#8220;How can
I let you go?&#8221; he exclaimed suddenly.</p>
<p>Myra leaned over, and smiled into his
adoring eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I go?&#8221; she whispered, tenderly.</p>
<p>Jim Airth took both her hands in his. His
eyes blazed up into hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Myra,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when shall we be
married?&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra&#8217;s face flamed, just as the soft white
clouds had flamed when the sun arose.
But she met the fire of his eyes without
flinching.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you will, Jim,&#8221; she answered
gently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as possible, then,&#8221; said Jim
Airth, eagerly.</p>
<p>Myra withdrew her hands, and mounted
two more steps; then turned to bend and
whisper: &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; replied Jim Airth, &#8220;I do not
know how to bear that there should be a day,
or an hour, or a minute, when we cannot be
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, do you feel that, too?&#8221; whispered
Myra.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too?&#8221; cried Jim Airth. &#8220;Do <i>you</i>&mdash;Myra!
Come back!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Lady Ingleby fled up the stairs like a
hare. She had not run so fast since she was
a little child of ten. He heard her happy
laugh, and the closing of her door.</p>
<p>Then he unbarred the front entrance; and
stepping out, stood in the sunshine, on the
path where he had seen his Fairy-land Princess
arrive.</p>
<p>He stretched his arms over his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mine, altogether! Oh,
my God! At last, I have won the Highest!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>Then he raced down the street to the beach;
and five minutes later, in the full strength of
his vigorous manhood, he was swimming up
the golden path, towards the rising sun.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>GOLDEN DAYS</h3>
</div>

<p>The week which followed was one of ideal
joy and holiday. Both knew, instinctively,
that no after days could ever be quite
as these first days. They were an experience
which came not again, and must be realised
and enjoyed with whole-hearted completeness.</p>
<p>At first Jim Airth talked with determination
of a special licence, and pleaded for no delay.
But Lady Ingleby, usually vague to a degree
on all questions of law or matters of business,
fortunately felt doubtful as to whether it
would be wise to be married in a name other
than her own; and, though she might have
solved the difficulty by at once revealing her
identity to Jim Airth, she was anxious to
choose her own time and place for this revelation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
and had set her heart upon making it
amid the surroundings of her own beautiful
home at Shenstone.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Jim,&#8221; she urged, &#8220;I <i>have</i> a few
friends in town and at Shenstone, who take
an interest in my doings; and I could hardly
reappear among them married! Could I,
Jim? It would seem such an unusual and
unexpected termination to a rest-cure.
Wouldn&#8217;t it, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth&#8217;s big laugh brought Miss Susie
to the window. It caused sad waste of
Susannah&#8217;s time, that her window looked out
on the honeysuckle arbour.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might make quite a run on rest-cures,&#8221;
said Jim Airth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but they couldn&#8217;t all meet <i>you</i>,&#8221;
said Myra; and the look he received from those
sweet eyes, atoned for the vague inaccuracy
of the rejoinder.</p>
<p>So they agreed to have one week of this free
untrammelled life, before returning to the
world of those who knew them; and he promised
to come and see her in her own home,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
before taking the final steps which should make
her altogether his.</p>
<p>So they went gay walks along the cliffs in
the breezy sunshine; and Myra, clinging to
Jim&#8217;s arm, looked down from above upon
their ledge.</p>
<p>They revisited Horseshoe Cove at low
water, and Jim Airth spent hours cutting the
hurried niches into proper steps, so as to leave
a staircase to the ledge, up which people, who
chanced in future to be caught by the tide,
might climb to safety. Myra sat on the beach
and watched him, her eyes alight with tender
memories; but she absolutely refused to mount
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Jim,&#8221; she said; &#8220;not until we come
here on our honeymoon. Then, if you wish,
you shall take your wife back to the place
where we passed those wonderful hours. But
not now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim, who expected always to have his own
way, unless he was given excellent reasons in
black and white for not having it, was about
to expostulate and insist, when he saw tears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
on her lashes and a quiver of the sweet smiling
lips, and gave in at once without further
question.</p>
<p>They hired a tent, and pitched it on the
shore at Tregarth, Myra telegraphed for a
bathing-dress, and Jim went into the sea in
his flannels and tried to teach her to swim,
holding her up beneath her chin and saying;
&#8220;One, two! <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>ONE, TWO</span>!&#8221; far louder than Myra
had ever had it said to her before. Thus,
amid much splashing and laughter, Lady
Ingleby accomplished her swim of ten yards.</p>
<p>Miss Murgatroyd was shocked; nay,
more than shocked. Miss Murgatroyd was
scandalised! She took to her bed forthwith,
expecting Miss Eliza and Miss Susannah to
follow her example&mdash;in the spirit, if not to the
letter. But, released from Amelia&#8217;s personal
supervision, romantic little Susie led Eliza
astray; and the two took a furtive and fearful
joy in seeing all they could of the &#8220;goings on&#8221;
of the couple who had boldly converted the
prosaic Cornish hotel into a land of excitement
and romance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>From the moment when on the morning
after their adventure, Myra, with yellow roses
in the belt of her white gown, had swept into
the coffee-room at five minutes past nine,
saying: &#8220;My dear Jim, have I kept you
waiting? I hope the coffee is not cold?&#8221;&mdash;all
life had seemed transformed to Miss
Susie. Turning quickly, she had caught the
look Jim Airth gave to the lovely woman who
took her place opposite him at his hitherto
lonely table, and, still smiling into his eyes,
lifted the coffee-pot.</p>
<p>Amelia&#8217;s stern whisper had recalled her to
her senses, and prevented any further glancing
round; but she had heard Myra say: &#8220;I forgot
your sugar, Jim. One lump, or two?&#8221; and
Jim Airth&#8217;s reply: &#8220;As usual, thanks, dear,&#8221;
not knowing, that with a silent twinkle of
fun, he laid an envelope over his cup, as a
sign to Myra, waiting with poised sugar-tongs,
that &#8220;as usual&#8221; meant no sugar at all!</p>
<p>Later on, when she one day met Lady
Ingleby alone in a passage, Miss Susannah
ventured two hurried questions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, tell me, my dear! Is it <i>really</i> true
that you are going to marry Mr. Airth? And
have you known him long?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Myra smiling down into Susie&#8217;s plump
anxious face replied: &#8220;Well, as a matter of
fact, Miss Susannah, Jim Airth is going to
marry <i>me</i>. And I cannot explain how long
I have known him. I seem to have known
him all my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; whispered Miss Susannah with a
knowing smile of conscious perspicacity;
&#8220;Eliza and I felt sure it was a tiff.&#8221;</p>
<p>This remark appeared absolutely incomprehensible
to Lady Ingleby; and not until
she had repeated it to Jim, and he had shouted
with laughter, and called her a bare-faced
deceiver, did she realise that the &#8220;tiff&#8221; was
supposed to have been operative during the
whole time she and Jim Airth had sat at
separate tables, and showed no signs of
acquaintance.</p>
<p>However, she smiled kindly into the archly
nodding face. Then, in the consciousness
of her own great happiness, enveloped little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
Susie in her beautiful arms, and kissed
her.</p>
<p>Miss Susannah never forgot that embrace.
It was to her a reflected realisation of what it
must be to be loved by Jim Airth. And,
thereafter, whenever Miss Murgatroyd saw
fit to use such adjectives as &#8220;indecent,&#8221;
&#8220;questionable,&#8221; or &#8220;highly improper,&#8221; Miss
Susie bravely gathered up her wool-work,
and left the room.</p>
<p>Thus the golden days went by, and a letter
came for Jim Airth from Lady Ingleby&#8217;s
secretary. Her ladyship was away at present
but would be returning to Shenstone on the
following Monday, and would be pleased to
give him an interview on Tuesday afternoon.
The two o&#8217;clock express from Charing Cross
would be met at Shenstone station, unless he
wrote suggesting another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that is very civil,&#8221; said Jim to Myra,
as he passed her the letter, &#8220;and how well it
suits our plans. We had already arranged
both to go up to town on Monday, and you on
to Shenstone. So I can come down by that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
two o&#8217;clock train on Tuesday, get my interview
with Lady Ingleby over as quickly as may be,
and dash off to my girl at the Lodge. I hope
to goodness she won&#8217;t want to give me tea!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which &#8216;she&#8217;?&#8221; asked Myra, smiling. &#8220;<i>I</i>
shall certainly want to give you tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall decline Lady Ingleby&#8217;s,&#8221;
said Jim with decision.</p>
<p>Even during those wonderful days he went
on steadily with his book, Myra sitting near
him in the smoking-room, writing letters or
reading, while he worked. &#8220;I do better work
if you are within reach, or at all events, within
sight,&#8221; Jim had said; and it was impossible
that Lady Ingleby&#8217;s mind should not have
contrasted the thrill of pleasure this gave her,
with the old sense of being in the way if work
was to be done; and of being shut out from the
chief interests of Michael&#8217;s life, by the closing
of the laboratory door. Ah, how different
from the way in which Jim already made her
a part of himself, enfolding her into his every
interest.</p>
<p>She wrote fully of her happiness to Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
Dalmain, telling her in detail the unusual
happenings which had brought it so rapidly
to pass. Also a few lines to her old friend the
Duchess of Meldrum, merely announcing the
fact of her engagement and the date of her
return to Shenstone, promising full particulars
later. This letter held also a message for
Ronald and Billy, should they chance to be at
Overdene.</p>
<p>Sunday evening, their last at Tregarth,
came all too soon. They went to the little
church together, sitting among the simple
fisher folk at Evensong. As they looked over
one hymn book, and sang &#8220;Eternal Father,
strong to save,&#8221; both thought of &#8220;Davy
Jones&#8221; in the middle of the hymn, and had to
exchange a smile; yet with an instant added
reverence of petition and thanksgiving.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Thus evermore, shall rise to Thee,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Jim Airth&#8217;s big bass boomed through the
little church; and Myra, close to his shoulder,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
sang with a face so radiant that none could
doubt the reality of her praise.</p>
<p>Then back to a cold supper at the Moorhead
Inn; after which they strolled out to the
honeysuckle arbour for Jim&#8217;s evening pipe,
and a last quiet talk.</p>
<p>It was then that Jim Airth said, suddenly:
&#8220;By the way I wish you would tell me more
about Lady Ingleby. What kind of a woman
is she? Easy to talk to?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Myra was taken aback.
&#8220;Why, Jim&mdash;I hardly know. Easy?
Yes, I think <i>you</i> will find her easy to talk
to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she speak of her husband&#8217;s death,
or is it a tabooed subject?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She speaks of it,&#8221; said Myra, softly,
&#8220;to those who can understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Do you suppose she will like to hear
details of those last days?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly; if you feel inclined to give them,
Jim&mdash;do you know who did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>A surprised silence in the arbour. Jim
removed his pipe, and looked at her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do I know&mdash;who&mdash;did&mdash;what?&#8221; he asked
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the name of the man who
made the mistake which killed Lord Ingleby?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim returned his pipe to his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, I do,&#8221; he said, quietly. &#8220;But
how came you to know of the blunder? I
thought the whole thing was hushed up, at
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; said Myra; &#8220;but Lady Ingleby
was told, and I heard it then. Jim, if she
asked you the name, should you tell her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I should,&#8221; replied Jim Airth.
&#8220;I was strongly opposed, from the first, to
any mystery being made about it. I hate a
hushing-up policy. But there was the fellow&#8217;s
future to consider. The world never lets a
thing of that sort drop. He would always
have been pointed out as &#8216;The chap who killed
Ingleby&#8217;&mdash;just as if he had done it on purpose;
and every man of us knew that would be a
millstone round the neck of any career. And
then the whole business had been somewhat
irregular; and &#8216;the powers that be&#8217; have a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
way of taking all the kudos, if experiments are
successful; and making a what-on-earth-were-you-dreaming-of
row, if they chance to be a
failure. Hence the fact that we are all such
stick-in-the-muds, in the service. Nobody
dares be original. The risks are too great,
and too astonishingly unequal. If you succeed,
you get a D.S.O. from a grateful
government, and a laurel crown from an
admiring nation. If you fail, an indignant
populace derides your name, and a pained and
astonished government claps you into jail.
That&#8217;s not the way to encourage progress,
or make fellows prompt to take the initiative.
The right or the wrong of an action should not
be determined by its success or failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby&#8217;s mind had paused at the
beginning of Jim&#8217;s tirade.</p>
<p>&#8220;They could not have taken Michael&#8217;s
kudos,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It must have been
patented. He was always most careful to
patent all his inventions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, what?&#8221; said Jim Airth. &#8220;Oh, I see.
&#8216;Kudos,&#8217; my dear girl, means &#8216;glory&#8217;; not a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
new kind of explosive. And why do you call
Lord Ingleby &#8216;Michael&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew him intimately,&#8221; said Lady
Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Well, as I was saying, I protested
about the hushing up, but was talked over;
and the few who knew the facts pledged their
word of honour to keep silence. Only, the
name was to be given to Lady Ingleby, if she
desired to know it; and some of us thought
you might as well put it in <i>The Times</i> at
once, as tell a woman. Then we heard she had
decided not to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of her decision?&#8221;
asked Lady Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it proved her to be a very just-minded
woman, and a very unusual one, if
she keeps to it. But it would be rather like a
woman, to make a fine decision such as that
during the tension of a supreme moment, and
then indulge in private speculation afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear her reason, Jim? She
said she did not wish that a man should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
walk this earth, whose hand she could not
bring herself to touch in friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor loyal soul!&#8221; said Jim Airth, greatly
moved. &#8220;Myra, if <i>I</i> got accidentally done for,
as Ingleby was,&mdash;should <i>you</i> feel so, for my
sake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; cried Myra, passionately. &#8220;If I
lost <i>you</i>, my belovèd, I should never want to
touch any other man&#8217;s hand, in friendship or
otherwise, as long as I lived!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; mused Jim Airth. &#8220;Then you don&#8217;t
consider Lady Ingleby&#8217;s reason for her decision
proved a love such as ours?&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra laid her beautiful head against his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she said, brokenly, &#8220;I do not feel
myself competent to discuss any other love.
One thing only is clear to me;&mdash;I never
realised what love meant, until I knew <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>A long silence in the honeysuckle arbour.</p>
<p>Then Jim Airth cried almost fiercely to the
woman in his arms: &#8220;Can you really think
you have been right to keep me waiting, even
for a day?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>And she who loved him with a love beyond
expression could frame no words in answer
to that question. Thus it came to pass that,
in the days to come, it was there, unanswered;
ready to return and beat upon her brain with
merciless reiteration: &#8220;Was I right to keep
him waiting, even for a day.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>In the hall, beside the marble table, where
lay the visitors&#8217; book, they paused to say
good-night. From the first, Myra had never
allowed him up the stairs until her door was
closed. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t keep the rules I think
it right to make, Jim,&#8221; she had said, with her
little tender smile, &#8220;I shall, in self-defence,
engage Miss Murgatroyd as chaperon; and
what sort of a time would you have then?&#8221;</p>
<p>So Jim was pledged to remain below until
her door had been shut five minutes. After
which he used to tramp up the stairs whistling:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;A long long life, to my sweet wife,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>And mates at sea;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>And keep our bones from Davy Jones,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Where&#8217;er we be.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>And may you meet a mate as sweet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>Then his door would bang, and Myra
would venture to give vent to her suppressed
laughter, and to sing a soft little</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Yeo ho! we go!&mdash;Yeo ho! Yeo ho!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>for sheer overflowing happiness.</p>
<p>But this was the last evening. A parting
impended. Also there had been tense moments
in the honeysuckle arbour.</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s blue eyes were mutinous. He stood
holding her hands against his breast, as he had
done in Horseshoe Cove, when the waves
swept round their feet, and he had cried:
&#8220;You <i>must</i> climb!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So to-morrow night,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you will
be at the Lodge, Shenstone; and I, at my Club
in town. Do you know how hard it is to be
away from you, even for an hour? Do you
realise that if you had not been so obstinate
we never need have been parted at all? We
could have gone away from here, husband and
wife together. If you had really cared, you
wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra smiled up into his angry eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;it is <i>so</i> silly to say:
&#8216;<i>If</i> you had really cared&#8217;; because you know,
perfectly well, that I care for you, more
than any woman in the world has ever cared
for any man before! And I do assure you,
Jim, that you couldn&#8217;t have married me
<i>validly</i> from here&mdash;and think how awful it
would be, to love as much as we love and then
find out that we were not <i>validly</i> married&mdash;and
when you come to my home, and fetch
me away from there, you will admit&mdash;yes
really <i>admit</i>&mdash;that I was right. You will
have to apologise humbly for having said
&#8216;Bosh!&#8217; so often. Jim&mdash;dearest! Look at
the clock! I <i>must</i> go. Poor Miss Murgatroyd
will grow so tired of listening for us. She
always leaves her door a crack open. So
does Miss Susannah. They have all taken to
sleeping with their doors ajar. I deftly led
the conversation round to riddles yesterday,
when I was alone with them for a few minutes,
and asked sternly: &#8216;When is a door, not a
door?&#8217; They all answered: &#8216;When it is a jar!&#8217;
quite unabashed; and Miss Eliza asked another!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
I believe Susie stands at her crack, in
the darkness, in hopes of seeing you march by....
No, don&#8217;t say naughty words. They are
dears, all three of them; and we shall miss them
horribly to-morrow. Oh, Jim&mdash;I&#8217;ve just had
such a brilliant idea! I shall ask them to be
my bridesmaids! Can&#8217;t you see them following
me up the aisle? It would be worse than
the duchess giving Jane away. Ah, you don&#8217;t
know that story? I will tell it you, some day.
Jim, say &#8216;Good-night&#8217; quickly, and let me go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once,&#8221; said Jim Airth, tightening his grasp
on her wrists&mdash;&#8220;once, Myra, we said no
&#8216;good-night,&#8217; and no &#8216;good-morning.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim, darling!&#8221; said Myra, gently; &#8220;on that
night, before I went to sleep, you said to me:
&#8216;We are not alone. <i>God is here</i>.&#8217; And then
you repeated part of the hundred and thirty-ninth
psalm. And, Jim&mdash;I thought you the
best and strongest man I had ever known; and
I felt that, all my life, I should trust you, as I
trusted my God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth loosed the hands he had held so
tightly, and kissed them very gently. &#8220;Good-night,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
my sweetheart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and God
bless you!&#8221; Then he turned away to the
marble table.</p>
<p>Myra ran swiftly up the stairs and closed
her door.</p>
<p>Then she knelt beside her bed, and sobbed
uncontrollably; partly for joy, and partly for
sorrow. The unanswered question commenced
its reiteration: &#8220;Ah, was I right to
keep him waiting?&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently she lifted her head, held her
breath, and stared into the darkness. A
vision seemed to pass across her room. A
tall, bearded man, in evening clothes. In his
arms a tiny dog, peeping at her through its
curls, as if to say: &#8220;<i>I</i> have the better place.
Where do <i>you</i> come in?&#8221; The tall man
turned at the door. &#8220;Good-night, my dear
Myra,&#8221; he said, kindly.</p>
<p>The vision passed.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby buried her face in the bedclothes.
&#8220;That&mdash;for ten long years!&#8221; she
said. Then, in the darkness, she saw the
mutinous fire of Jim Airth&#8217;s blue eyes, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
felt the grip of his strong hands on hers.
&#8220;How can I say &#8216;Good-night&#8217;?&#8221; protested his
deep voice, passionately. And, with a rush
of happy tears, Myra clasped her hands,
whispering: &#8220;Dear God, am I at last to know
the Best?&#8221;</p>
<p>And up the stairs came Jim Airth, whistling
like a nightingale. But, as a concession to
Miss Murgatroyd&#8217;s ideas concerning suitable
Sabbath music, he discarded &#8220;Nancy Lee,&#8221;
and whistled:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Eternal Father, strong to save,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Whose arm hath bound the restless wave;</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>O hear us, when we cry to Thee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And, kneeling beside her bed, in the darkness,
Myra made of it her evening prayer.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;WHERE IS LADY INGLEBY?&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>When Jim Airth left the train on the following
Tuesday afternoon, he looked
eagerly up and down the platform, hoping to
see Myra. True, they had particularly arranged
not to meet, until after his interview
with Lady Ingleby. But Myra was so charmingly
inconsequent and impulsive in her
actions. It would be quite like her to reverse
the whole plan they had made; and, if her
desire to see him, in any measure resembled
his huge hunger for a sight of her, he could
easily understand such a reversal.</p>
<p>However, Myra was not there; and with a
heavy sense of unreasonable disappointment,
Jim Airth chucked his ticket to a waiting
porter, passed through the little station, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
found a smart turn-out, with tandem ponies,
waiting outside.</p>
<p>The groom at the leader&#8217;s head touched his
hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Shenstone Park, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jim Airth, and climbed
in.</p>
<p>The groom touched his hat again. &#8220;Her
ladyship said, sir, that perhaps you might
like to drive the ponies yourself, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said Jim Airth, shortly.
&#8220;I never drive other people&#8217;s ponies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The groom&#8217;s comprehending grin was immediately
suppressed. He touched his hat
again; gathered up the reins, mounted the
driver&#8217;s seat, flicked the leader, and the
perfectly matched ponies swung at once into
a fast trot.</p>
<p>Jim Airth, a connoisseur in horse-flesh, eyed
them with approval. They flew along the
narrow Surrey lanes, between masses of wild
roses and clematis. The villagers were working
in the hayfields, shouting gaily to one
another as they tossed the hay. It was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
matchless June day, in a perfect English
summer.</p>
<p>Jim Airth&#8217;s disappointment at Myra&#8217;s non-appearance,
was lifting rapidly in the enjoyment
of the drive. After all it was best to
adhere to plans once made; and every step of
these jolly little tapping hoofs was bringing
him nearer to the Lodge. Perhaps she would
be at the window. (He had particularly told
her <i>not</i> to be!)</p>
<p>&#8220;These ponies have been well handled,&#8221;
he remarked approvingly to the groom, as
they flew round a bend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the groom, with the inevitable
movement towards his hat, whip
and hand going up together. &#8220;Her ladyship
always drives them herself, sir. Fine
whip, her ladyship, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>This item of information surprised Jim
Airth. Judging by Lord Ingleby&#8217;s age and
appearance, he had expected to find Lady
Ingleby a sedate and stately matron of sixty.
It was somewhat surprising to hear of her
as a fine whip.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>However, he had no time to weigh the
matter further. Passing an ivy-clad church
on the village green, they swung through
massive iron gates, of very fine design, and
entered the stately avenue of Shenstone
Park. To the left, in a group of trees, stood
a pretty little gabled house.</p>
<p>&#8220;What house is that?&#8221; asked Jim Airth,
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lodge, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who lives there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. O&#8217;Mara, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Mrs. O&#8217;Mara returned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir. She was up at the
house with her ladyship this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she <i>has</i> returned,&#8221; said Jim Airth.</p>
<p>The groom looked perplexed, but made no
comment.</p>
<p>Jim Airth turned in his seat, and looked
back at the Lodge. It was a far smaller
house than he had expected. This fact did not
seem to depress him. He smiled to himself,
as at some thought which gave him amusement
and pleasure. While he still looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
back, a side door opened; a neatly dressed
woman in black, apparently a superior lady&#8217;s-maid,
appeared on the doorstep, shook out a
white table-cloth, and re-entered the house.</p>
<p>They flew on up the avenue, Jim Airth
noting every tree with appreciation and
pleasure. The fine old house came into view,
and a moment later they drew up at the
entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good driving,&#8221; remarked Jim Airth
approvingly, as he tipped the little groom.
Then he turned, to find the great doors
already standing wide, and a stately butler,
with immense black eyebrows, waiting to
receive him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come to her ladyship&#8217;s sitting-room,
sir?&#8221; said the butler, and led the way.</p>
<p>Jim Airth entered a charmingly appointed
room, and looked around.</p>
<p>It was empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kindly wait here, sir, while I acquaint
her ladyship with your arrival,&#8221; said the
pompous person with the eyebrows, and went
out noiselessly, closing the door behind him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>Left alone, Jim Airth commenced taking
rapid note of the room, hoping to gain therefrom
some ideas as to the tastes and character
of its possessor. But almost immediately his
attention was arrested by a life-size portrait of
Lord Ingleby, hanging above the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>Jim Airth walked over to the hearthrug, and
stood long, looking with silent intentness at
the picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; he said to himself, at last.
&#8220;Extraordinarily clever. That chap shall
paint Myra, if I can lay hands on him. What
a jolly little dog! And what devotion! Mutual
and absorbing. I suppose that is Peter.
Queer to think that I should have been the last
to hear him calling Peter. I wonder whether
Lady Ingleby liked Peter. If not, I doubt
if she would have had much of a look-in. If
anyone went to the wall it certainly wasn&#8217;t
Peter.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was still absorbed in the picture, when
the butler returned with a long message,
solemnly delivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her ladyship is out in the grounds, sir.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
As it is so warm in the house, sir, her ladyship
requests that you come to her in the grounds.
If you will allow me, sir, I will show you the
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth restrained an inclination to say:
&#8220;Buck up!&#8221; and followed the butler along a
corridor, down a wide staircase to a lower
hall. They stepped out on to a terrace running
the full length of the house. Below
it, an old-fashioned garden, with box borders,
bright flower beds, a fountain in the centre.
Beyond this a smooth lawn, sloping down to a
beautiful lake, which sparkled and gleamed
in the afternoon sunshine. On this lawn,
well to the right, half-way between the house
and the water, stood a group of beeches.
Beneath their spreading boughs, in the cool
inviting shadow, were some garden chairs.
Jim Airth could just discern, in one of these,
the white gown of a woman, holding a scarlet
parasol.</p>
<p>The butler indicated this clump of trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her ladyship said, sir, that she would
await you under the beeches.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>He returned to the house, and Jim Airth
was left to make his way alone to Lady
Ingleby, guided by the gleam among the trees
of her brilliant parasol. Even at that moment
it gave him pleasure to find Lady
Ingleby&#8217;s taste in sunshades, resembling
Myra&#8217;s.</p>
<p>He stood for a minute on the terrace, taking
in the matchless beauty of the place. Then
his face grew sad and stern. &#8220;What a home
to leave,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and to leave it, never to
return!&#8221;</p>
<p>He still wore a look of sadness as he descended
the steps leading to the flower garden,
made his way along the narrow gravel paths;
then stepped on to the soft turf of the lawn,
and walked towards the clump of beeches.</p>
<p>Jim Airth&mdash;tall and soldierly, broad-shouldered
and erect&mdash;might have made an
excellent impression upon Lady Ingleby, had
she watched his coming. But she kept her
parasol between herself and her approaching
guest.</p>
<p>In fact he drew quite near; near enough to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
distinguish the ripples of soft lace about, her
feet, the long graceful sweep of her gown; and
still she seemed unconscious of his close
proximity.</p>
<p>He passed beneath the beeches and stood
before her. And, even then, the parasol
concealed her face.</p>
<p>But Jim Airth was never at a loss, when sure
of his ground. &#8220;Lady Ingleby,&#8221; he said,
with grave formality; &#8220;I was told to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the parasol was flung aside, and he
found himself looking down into the lovely
laughing eyes of Myra.</p>
<p>To see Jim Airth&#8217;s face change from its
look of formal gravity to one of rapturous
delight, was to Myra well worth the long effort
of sitting immovable. He flung himself down
before her with boyish abandon, and clasped
both herself and her chair in his long arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you darling!&#8221; he said, bending his face
over hers, while his blue eyes danced with
delight. &#8220;Oh, Myra, what centuries since
yesterday! How I have longed for you. I
almost hoped you would after all have come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
to the station. How I have grudged wasting
all this time in coming to call on old Lady
Ingleby. Myra, has it seemed long to you?
Do you realise, my dear girl, that it <i>can&#8217;t</i> go
on any longer; that we cannot possibly live
through another twenty-four hours of separation?
But oh, you Tease! There was I, ramping
with impatience at every wasted moment;
and here were you, sitting under this tree,
hiding your face and pretending to be Lady
Ingleby! The astonished and astonishing old
party in the eyebrows, certainly pointed you
out as Lady Ingleby when he started me off
on my pilgrimage. I say, how lovely you
look! What billowy softness! It wouldn&#8217;t
do for cliff-climbing; but its A.I. for sitting
on lawns.... I can&#8217;t help it! I must!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Myra, laughing and pushing
him away; &#8220;what has come to you, you dearest
old boy? You will really have to behave!
We are not in the honeysuckle arbour. &#8216;The
astonishing old party in the eyebrows&#8217; is most
likely observing us from a window, and will
have good cause to look astonished, if he sees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
you &#8216;carrying on&#8217; in such a manner. Jim,
how nice you look in your town clothes. I
always like a grey frock-coat. Stand up, and
let me see.... Oh, look at the green of the
turf on those immaculate knees! What a
pity. Did you don all this finery for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not, silly!&#8221; said Jim Airth,
rubbing his knees vigorously. &#8220;When I haul
you up cliffs, I wear old Norfolk coats; and
when I duck you in the sea, I wear flannels. I
considered this the correct attire in which to
pay a formal call on Lady Ingleby; and now,
before she has had a chance of being duly
impressed by it, I have spoilt my knees hopelessly,
worshipping at your shrine! Where is
Lady Ingleby? Why doesn&#8217;t she keep her
appointments?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Myra, looking up at him with
eyes full of unspeakable love, yet dancing
with excitement and delight; &#8220;Jim, do you
admire this place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This place?&#8221; cried Jim, stepping back a
pace, so as to command a good view of the
lake and woods beyond. &#8220;It is absolutely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
perfect. We have nothing like this in Scotland.
You can&#8217;t beat for all round beauty a
real old mellow lived-in English country
seat; especially when you get a twenty acre
lake, with islands and swans, all complete.
And I suppose the woods beyond, as far as one
can see, belong to the Inglebys&mdash;or rather, to
Lady Ingleby. What a pity there is no
son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Myra, &#8220;I have so looked forward
to showing you my home.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped close to her at once. &#8220;Then
show it to me, dear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would
rather be alone with you in your own little
home&mdash;I saw it, as we drove up&mdash;than waiting
about, in this vast expanse of beauty, for
Lady Ingleby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Myra, &#8220;do you remember a
little tune I often hummed down in Cornwall;
and, when you asked me what it was, I said
you should hear the words some day?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim looked puzzled. &#8220;Really dear&mdash;you
hummed so many little tunes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know,&#8221; said Myra; &#8220;and I have not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
much ear. But this was very special. I
want to sing it to you now. Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>And looking up at him, her soft eyes full
of love, Myra sang, with slight alterations of
her own, the last verse of the old Scotch
ballad, &#8220;Huntingtower.&#8221;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Blair in Athol&#8217;s mine, Jamie,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Fair Dunkeld is mine, laddie;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Saint Johnstown&#8217;s bower,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>And Huntingtower,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>And all that&#8217;s mine, is thine, laddie.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Very pretty,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;but you&#8217;ve
mixed it, my dear. Jamie bestowed all his
possessions on the lassie. You sang it the
wrong way round.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; cried Myra, eagerly. &#8220;There
<i>is</i> no wrong way round. Providing they both
love, it does not really matter which gives.
The one who happens to possess, bestows. If
you were a cowboy, Jim, and you loved a
woman with lands and houses, in taking her,
you would take all that was hers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;d take her out to my ranch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
and teach her to milk cows,&#8221; laughed Jim
Airth. Then turning about under the tree
and looking in all directions: &#8220;But seriously,
Myra, where is Lady Ingleby? She should
keep her appointments. We cannot waste
our whole afternoon waiting here. I want
my girl; and I want her in her own little home,
alone. Cannot we find Lady Ingleby?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Myra rose, radiant, and came and
stood before him. The sunbeams shone
through the beech leaves and danced in her
grey eyes. She had never looked more
perfect in her sweet loveliness. The man
took it all in, and the glory of possession
lighted his handsome face.</p>
<p>She came and stood before him, laying her
hands upon his breast. He wrapped his
arms lightly about her. He saw she had
something to say; and he waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Myra, &#8220;Jim, dearest. There is
just one name I want to bear, more than any
other. There is just one thing I long to be.
Then I shall be content. I want to have the
right to be called &#8216;Mrs. Jim Airth.&#8217; I want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
more than all else beside, to be your wife.
But&mdash;until I am that; and may it be very soon!
until you make me &#8216;Mrs. Jim Airth&#8217;&mdash;dearest&mdash;<i>I</i>&mdash;am
Lady Ingleby.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>UNDER THE BEECHES AT SHENSTONE</h3>
</div>

<p>Jim Airth&#8217;s arms fell slowly to his sides.
He still looked into those happy, loving
eyes, but the joy in his own died out, leaving
them merely cold blue steel. His face slowly
whitened, hardened, froze into lines of silent
misery. Then he moved back a step, and
Myra&#8217;s hands fell from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i>&mdash;&#8216;Lady Ingleby&#8217;?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Myra gazed at him, in unspeakable dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Jim, dearest! Why
should you mind it so much?&#8221;</p>
<p>She moved forward, and tried to take his
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch me!&#8221; he said, sharply. Then:
&#8220;<i>You</i>, Myra? You! Lord Ingleby&#8217;s widow?&#8221;</p>
<p>The furious misery of his voice stung Myra.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Why should he resent the noble name she bore,
the high rank which was hers? Even if it
placed her socially far above him, had she
not just expressed her readiness&mdash;her longing&mdash;to
resign all, for him? Had not her love
already placed him on the topmost pinnacle
of her regard? Was it generous, was it
worthy of Jim Airth to take her disclosure
thus?</p>
<p>She moved towards the chairs, with gentle
dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us sit down, Jim, and talk it over,&#8221;
she said, quietly. &#8220;I do not think you need
find it so overwhelming a matter as you seem
to imagine. Let me tell you all about it;
or rather, suppose you ask me any questions
you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth sat blindly down upon the chair
farthest from her, put his elbows on his knees,
and sank his face into his hands.</p>
<p>Without any comment, Myra rose; moved
her chair close enough to enable her to lay
her hand upon his arm, should she wish to
do so; sat down again, and waited in silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>Jim Airth had but one question to ask.
He asked it, without lifting his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Mrs. O&#8217;Mara?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is the widow of Sergeant O&#8217;Mara who
fell at Targai. We both lost our husbands in
that disaster, Jim. She had been for many
years my maid-attendant. When she married
the sergeant, a fine soldier whom Michael
held in high esteem, I wished still to keep her
near me. Michael had given me the Lodge
to do with as I pleased. I put them into it.
She lives there still. Oh, Jim dearest, try to
realise that I have not said one word to you
which was not completely truthful! Let me
explain how I came to be in Cornwall under
her name instead of my own. If I might put
my hand in yours, Jim, I could tell you more
easily.... No? Very well; never mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;After I received the telegram last November
telling me of my husband&#8217;s death, I had a
very bad nervous breakdown. I do not
think it was caused so much by my loss, as by
a prolonged mental strain, which had preceded
it. Just as I had moved to town and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
getting better, full details arrived, and I had
to be told that it had been an accident. You
know all about the question as to whether
I should hear the name or not. You also
know my decision. The worry of this threw
me back. What you said in the arbour was
perfectly true. I <i>am</i> a woman, Jim; often,
a weak one; and I was very much alone. I
decided rightly, in a supreme moment&mdash;possibly
you may know who it was who
graciously undertook to bring me the news
from the War Office&mdash;but, afterwards, I
began to wonder; I allowed myself to guess.
Men from the front came home. My surmisings
circled ceaselessly around two&mdash;dear
fellows, of whom I was really fond. At last
I felt convinced I knew, by intangible yet
unmistakable signs, which was he who had
done it. I grew quite sure. And then&mdash;I
hardly know how to tell you, Jim&mdash;of all
impossible horrors! The man who had killed
Michael wanted to marry <i>me</i>!&mdash;Oh, don&#8217;t
groan, darling; you make me so unhappy!
But I do not wonder you find it difficult to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
believe. He cared very much, poor boy; and
I suppose he thought that, as I should remain
in ignorance, the <i>fact</i> need not matter. It
seems hard to understand; but a man in love
sometimes loses all sense of proportion&mdash;at
least so I once heard someone say; or words to
that effect. I did not allow it ever to reach
the point of an actual proposal; but I felt I
must flee away. There were others&mdash;and
it was terrible to me. I loved none of them;
and I had made up my mind never to marry
again unless I found my ideal. Oh, Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>She laid her hand upon his knee. It might
have been a falling leaf, for all the sign he
gave. She left it there, and went on speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;People gossiped. Society papers contained
constant trying paragraphs. Even my widow&#8217;s
weeds were sketched and copied. My nerves
grew worse. Life seemed unendurable.</p>
<p>&#8220;At last I consulted a great specialist, who
is also a trusted friend. He ordered me a
rest-cure. Not to be shut up within four
walls with my own worries, but to go right
away alone; to leave my own identity, and all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
appertaining thereto, completely behind; to
go to a place to which I had never before been,
where I knew no one, and should not be
known; to live in the open air; fare simply;
rise early, retire early; but, above
all, as he quaintly said: &#8216;Leave Lady Ingleby
behind.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I followed his advice to the letter. He is
not a man one can disobey. I did not like the
idea of taking a fictitious name, so I decided
to be &#8216;Mrs. O&#8217;Mara,&#8217; and naturally entered
her address in the visitors&#8217; book, as well as her
name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that evening of arrival! You were
quite right, Jim. I felt just a happy child,
entering a new world of beauty and delight&mdash;all
holiday and rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then&mdash;I saw you! And, oh my
belovèd, I think almost from the first moment
my soul flew to you, as to its unquestioned
mate! Your vitality became my source of
vigour; your strength filled and upheld everything
in me which had been weak and faltering.
I owed you much, before we had really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
spoken. Afterwards, I owed you life itself,
and love, and all&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>ALL</span>, Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra paused, silently controlling her emotion;
then, bending forward, laid her lips upon
the roughness of his hair. It might have been
the stirring of the breeze, for all the sign he
made.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I found at first that you had come
from the war, when I realised that you must
have known Michael, I praised the doctor&#8217;s
wisdom in making me drop my own name.
Also the Murgatroyds would have known it
immediately, and I should have had no peace,
As it was, Miss Murgatroyd occasionally
held forth in the sitting-room concerning
&#8216;poor dear Lady Ingleby,&#8217; whom she gave us
to understand she knew intimately. And
then&mdash;oh, Jim! when I came to know my
cosmopolitan cowboy; when he told me he
hated titles and all that appertained to them;
then indeed I blessed the moment when I
had writ myself down plain &#8216;Mrs. O&#8217;Mara&#8217;;
and I resolved not to tell him of my title until
he loved me enough not to mind it, or wanted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
me enough, to change me at once from Lady
Ingleby of Shenstone Park, into plain Mrs.
Jim Airth of&mdash;anywhere he chooses to take me!</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you will understand why I felt I
could not marry you validly in Cornwall;
and I wanted&mdash;was it selfish?&mdash;I wanted the
joy of revealing my own identity when I had
you, at last, in my own beautiful home. Oh,
my dear&mdash;my dear! Cannot our love stand
the test of so light a thing as this?&#8221;</p>
<p>She ceased speaking and waited.</p>
<p>She was sure of her victory; but it seemed
strange, in dealing with so fine a nature as that
of the man she loved, that she should have had
to fight so hard over what appeared to her a
paltry matter. But she knew false pride
often rose gigantic about the smallest things;
the very unworthiness of the cause seeming
to add to the unreasonable growth of its
dimensions.</p>
<p>She was deeply hurt; but she was a woman,
and she loved him. She waited patiently to
see his love for her arise victorious over
unworthy pride.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>At last Jim Airth stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot face it yet,&#8221; he said, slowly. &#8220;I
must be alone. I ought to have known from
the very first that you were&mdash;are&mdash;Lady
Ingleby. I am very sorry that you should
have to suffer for that which is no fault of
your own. I must&mdash;go&mdash;now. In twenty-four
hours, I will come back to talk it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned, without another word; without
a touch; without a look. He swung round on
his heel, and walked away across the lawn.</p>
<p>Myra&#8217;s dismayed eyes could scarcely follow
him.</p>
<p>He mounted the terrace; passed into the
house. A door closed.</p>
<p>Jim Airth was gone!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;SURELY YOU KNEW?&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Myra Ingleby rose and wended her
way slowly towards the house.</p>
<p>A stranger meeting her would probably
have noticed nothing amiss with the tall
graceful woman, whose pallor might well have
been due to the unusual warmth of the day.</p>
<p>But the heart within her was dying.</p>
<p>Her joy had received a mortal wound. The
man she adored, with a love which had placed
him at the highest, was slowly slipping from
his pedestal, and her hands were powerless
to keep him there.</p>
<p>A woman may drag her own pride in the
dust, and survive the process; but when the
man she loves falls, then indeed her heart dies
within her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>She had loved to call Jim Airth a cowboy.
She knew him to be avowedly cosmopolitan.
But was he also a slave to vulgar pride? Being
plain Jim Airth himself, did he grudge noble
birth and ancient lineage to those to whom
they rightfully belonged? Professing to scorn
titles, did he really set upon them so exaggerated
a value, that he would turn from the
woman he was about to wed, merely because
she owned a title, while he had none?</p>
<p>Myra, entering the house, passed to her
sitting-room. Green awnings shaded the
windows. The fireplace was banked with
ferns and lilies. Bowls of roses stood about;
while here and there pots of growing freesias
poured their delicate fragrance around.</p>
<p>Myra crossed to the hearthrug and stood
gazing up at the picture of Lord Ingleby.
The gentle refinement of the scholarly face
seemed accentuated by the dim light. Lady
Ingleby dwelt in memory upon the consistent
courtesy of the dead man&#8217;s manner; his
unfailing friendliness and equability to all;
courteous to men of higher rank, considerate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
to those of lower; genial to rich and poor
alike.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Michael,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;have I been
unfaithful? Have I forgotten how good you
were?&#8221;</p>
<p>But still her heart died within her. The
man who had stalked across the lawn, leaving
her without a touch or look, held it in the
hollow of his hand.</p>
<p>A dog-cart clattered up to the portico.
Men&#8217;s voices sounded in the hall. Tramping
feet hurried along the corridor. Then Billy&#8217;s
excited young voice cried, &#8220;May we come in?&#8221;
followed by Ronnie&#8217;s deeper tones, &#8220;If we
shall not be in the way?&#8221; The next moment
she was grasping a hand of each.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear boys!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have never
been more glad to see you! Do sit down; or
have you come to play tennis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have come to see <i>you</i>, dear Queen,&#8221;
said Billy. &#8220;We are staying at Overdene.
The duchess had your letter. She told us the
great news; also, that you were returning
yesterday. So we came over to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To congratulate,&#8221; said Ronald Ingram;
and he said it heartily and bravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Myra, smiling at them,
but her sweet voice was tremulous. These
first congratulations, coming just now, were
almost more than she could bear. Then,
with characteristic simplicity and straightforwardness,
she told these old friends the
truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear boys! It is quite sweet of you
to come over; and an hour ago, you would have
found me radiant. There cannot have been
a happier woman in the whole world than I.
But, you know, I met him, and we became
engaged, while I was doing my very original
rest-cure, which consisted chiefly in being
Mrs. O&#8217;Mara, to all intents and purposes,
instead of myself. This afternoon he knows
for the first time that I am Lady Ingleby of
Shenstone. And, boys, the shock has been
too much for him. He is such a splendid
man; but a dear delightful cowboy sort of
person. He has lived a great deal abroad,
and been everything you can imagine that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
bestrides a horse and does brave things. He
finished up at your horrid little war, and got
fever at Targai. You must have known
him. He calls it &#8216;a muddle on the frontier,&#8217;
and now he is writing a book about it, and
about other muddles, and how to avoid them.
But he has a quite eccentric dislike to titles
and big properties; so he has shied really
badly at mine. He has gone off to &#8216;face it out&#8217;
alone. Hence you find me sad instead of gay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy looked at Ronnie, telegraphing: &#8220;Is
it? It must be! Shall we tell her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ronnie telegraphed back: &#8220;It is! It can
be no other. <i>You</i> tell her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby became aware of these crosscurrents.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, boys?&#8221; she said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Queen,&#8221; cried Billy, with hardly
suppressed excitement; &#8220;may we ask the
cowboy person&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Airth,&#8221; replied Lady Ingleby, a
sudden rush of colour flooding her pale cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;he is the chap
we met tearing along to the railway station,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
as if all the furies were loose at his heels. He
looked neither to the right nor to the left,
nor, for that matter, in front of him; and our
dog-cart had to take to the path! So he did
not see two old comrades, nor did he hear their
hail. But he cannot possibly have been
fleeing from your title, dear lady, and hardly
from your property; seeing that his own title
is about the oldest known in Scottish history;
while mile after mile of moor and stream and
forest belong to him. Surely you knew that
the fellow who called himself &#8216;Jim Airth&#8217; when
out ranching in the West, and still keeps it
as his <i>nom-de-plume</i>, is&mdash;when at home&mdash;James,
Earl of Airth and Monteith, and a
few other names I have forgotten;&mdash;the finest
old title in Scotland!&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>WHAT BILLY HAD TO TELL</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Did you bring your rackets, boys?&#8221;
Lady Ingleby had said, with fine self-control;
adding, when they admitted rackets
left in the hall, &#8220;Ah, I am glad you never can
resist the chestnut court. It seems ages since
I saw you two fight out a single. Do go on
and begin. I will order tea out there in half
an hour, and follow you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she escaped to the terrace, flew across
garden and lawn, and sought the shelter of the
beeches. Arrived there, she sank into the
chair in which Jim Airth had sat so immovable,
and covered her face with her trembling
fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim, Jim!&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;My darling,
how grievously I wronged you! My king
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
among men! How I misjudged you! Imputing
to you thoughts of which you, in your
noble large-heartedness, would scarcely know
the meaning. Oh, my dear, forgive me!
And oh, come to me through this darkness and
explain what I have done wrong; explain
what it is you have to face; tell me what
has come between us. For indeed, if you
leave me, I shall die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra now felt certain that the fault was
hers; and she suffered less than when she had
thought it his. Yet she was sorely perplexed.
For, if the Earl of Airth and Monteith might
write himself down &#8220;Jim Airth&#8221; in the Moorhead
Inn visitors&#8217; book, and be blameless,
why might not Lady Ingleby of Shenstone
take an equally simple name, without committing
an unpardonable offence?</p>
<p>Myra pondered, wept, and reasoned round
in a circle, growing more and more bewildered
and perplexed.</p>
<p>But by-and-by she went indoors and tried to
remove all traces of recent tears. She must
not let her sorrow make her selfish. Ronald
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
and Billy would be wanting tea, and expecting
her to join them.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Meanwhile the two friends, their rackets
under their arms, had strolled through the
shrubbery at the front of the house, to the
beautiful tennis lawns, long renowned as being
the most perfect in the neighbourhood. Many
a tournament had there been fought out, in
presence of a gay crowd, lining the courts,
beneath the shady chestnut trees.</p>
<p>But on this day the place seemed sad and
deserted. They played one set, in silence,
hardly troubling to score; then walked to the
net and stood close together, one on either side.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must tell her,&#8221; said Ronald, examining
his racket, minutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we must,&#8221; agreed Billy, reluctantly.
&#8220;We could not let her marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duffer! you don&#8217;t suppose he would dream
of marrying her? He will come back, and tell
her himself to-morrow. We must tell her,
to spare her that interview. She need never
see him again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Ron! Did you see her go quite
pink when she told us his name? And in spite
of the trouble to-day, she looks half a dozen
years younger than when she went away.
You know she does, old man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s the rest-cure,&#8221; explained Ronnie,
but without much conviction. &#8220;Rest-cures
always have that effect. That&#8217;s why
women go in for them. Did you ever hear of a
man doing a rest-cure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve heard of <i>you</i>, at Overdene,&#8221;
said Billy, maliciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rot! You don&#8217;t call staying with the
duchess a rest-cure? Good heavens, man!
You get about the liveliest time of your life
when her Grace of Meldrum undertakes to
nurse you. Did you hear about old Pilberry
the parson, and the toucan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, shut up. You&#8217;ve told me that unholy
story twice already. I say, Ronnie!
We are begging the question. Who&#8217;s to tell
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; said Ronald decidedly. &#8220;She cares
for you like a mother, and will take it more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
easily from you. Then I can step in, later
on, with&mdash;er&mdash;<i>manly</i> comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound you!&#8221; said Billy, highly indignant.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not such a kid as you make
out. But I&#8217;ll tell you this:&mdash;If I thought it
would be for her real happiness, and could be
pulled through, I would tell her I did it; then
find Airth to-morrow and tell him I had told
her so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ass!&#8221; said Ronnie, affectionately. &#8220;As if
that could mend matters. Don&#8217;t you know
the earl? He was against the hushing-up
business from the first. He would simply
punch your head for daring to lie to her, and
go and tell her the exact truth himself. Besides,
at this moment, he is thinking more of his side
of the question, than of hers. We fellows
have a way of doing that. If he had thought
first of her, he would have stayed with her
and seen her through, instead of rushing off
like this, leaving her heart-broken and perplexed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound him!&#8221; said Billy, earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Billy! You know women.&#8221; It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
was the first time Ronnie had admitted this.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think&mdash;if a woman turned in
horror from a man she had loved, she might&mdash;if
he were tactfully on the spot&mdash;turn <i>to</i> a
man who had long loved her, and of whom
she had undoubtedly been fond?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My knowledge of women,&#8221; declaimed
Billy, dramatically, &#8220;leads me to hope that
she would fall into the arms of the man who
loved her well enough to risk incurring her
displeasure by bravely telling her himself that
which she ought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound you!&#8221; whispered Ronnie, who
had glanced past Billy, &#8220;Shut up!&mdash;The
meshes of this net are better than the other,
and the new patent sockets undoubtedly
keep it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You patient people!&#8221; said Lady Ingleby&#8217;s
voice, just behind Billy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you badly
need tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were admiring the new net,&#8221; said
Ronald Ingram, frowning at Billy, who with
his back to Lady Ingleby, continued admiring
the new net, helplessly speechless!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>There were brave attempts at merriment
during tea. Ronald told all the latest Overdene
stories; then described the annual concert
which had just taken place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Dalmain was there, and sang divinely.
She sings her husband&#8217;s songs; he accompanies
her. It is awfully fine to see the light on his
blind face as he listens, while her glorious voice
comes pouring forth. When the song is over,
he gets up from the piano, gives her his arm,
and apparently leads her off. Very few people
realise that, as a matter of fact, she is guiding
him. She gave, as an encore, a jolly little new
thing of his&mdash;quite simple&mdash;but everybody
wanted it twice over; an air like summer wind
blowing through a pine wood, with an accompaniment
like a blackbird whistling; words
something about &#8216;On God&#8217;s fair earth, &#8217;mid
blossoms blue&#8217;&mdash;I forget the rest. Go
ahead, Bill!&#8221;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;There is no room for sad despair,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>When heaven&#8217;s love is everywhere.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>quoted Billy, who had an excellent memory.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>Myra rose, hastily. &#8220;I must go in,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;But play as long as you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy walked beside her towards the shrubbery.
&#8220;May I come in and see you, presently,
dear Queen? There is something I want to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come when you will, Billy-boy,&#8221; said
Lady Ingleby, with a smile. &#8220;You will find
me in my sitting-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Billy looked furtively at Ronald,
hoping he had not seen. Words and smile
undoubtedly partook of the maternal!</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was a very grave-faced young man who,
half an hour later, appeared in Lady Ingleby&#8217;s
sitting-room, closing the door carefully behind
him. Lady Ingleby knew at once that he had
come on some matter which, at all events to
himself, appeared of paramount importance.
Billy&#8217;s days of youthful escapades were over.
This must be something more serious.</p>
<p>She rose from her davenport and came to
the sofa. &#8220;Sit down, Billy,&#8221; she said, indicating
an armchair opposite&mdash;Lord Ingleby&#8217;s
chair, and little Peter&#8217;s. Both had now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
left it empty. Billy filled it readily, unconscious
of its associations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rippin&#8217; flowers,&#8221; remarked Billy, looking
round the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby. She devoutly
hoped Billy was not going to propose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jolly room,&#8221; said Billy; &#8220;at least, I always
think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby. &#8220;So do I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy&#8217;s eyes, roaming anxiously around for
fresh inspiration, lighted on the portrait over
the mantelpiece. He started and paled. Then
he knew his hour had come. There must
be no more beating about the bush.</p>
<p>Billy was a soldier, and a brave one. He
had led a charge once, running up a hill ahead
of his men, in face of a perfect hail of bullets.
First came Billy; then the battalion. Not a
man could keep within fifty yards of him.
They always said afterwards that Billy came
through that charge alive, because he sprinted
so fast, that no bullets could touch him. He
rushed at the subject now, with the same
headlong courage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lady Ingleby,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is something
Ronnie and I both think you ought to
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there, Billy?&#8221; said Myra. &#8220;Then
suppose you tell it me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have sworn not to tell,&#8221; continued
Billy; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t care a damn&mdash;I mean a
pin&mdash;for an oath, if <i>your</i> happiness is at
stake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not break an oath, Billy, even
for my sake,&#8221; said Myra, gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see&mdash;<i>if you wished it</i>, you were
to be the one exception.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly Lady Ingleby understood. &#8220;Oh,
Billy!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Does Ronald wish me to
be told?&#8221;</p>
<p>This gave Billy a pang. So Ronnie really
counted after all, and would walk in&mdash;over
the broken hearts of Billy and another&mdash;in
rôle of manly comforter. It was hard; but,
loyally, Billy made answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Ronnie says it is only right; and I
think so too. I&#8217;ve come to do it, if you will
let me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>Lady Ingleby sat, with clasped hands,
considering. After all, what did it matter?
What did anything matter, compared to the
trouble with Jim?</p>
<p>She looked up at the portrait; but Michael&#8217;s
pictured face, intent on little Peter, gave her
no sign.</p>
<p>If these boys wished to tell her, and get it
off their minds, why should she not know?
It would put a stop, once for all, to Ronnie&#8217;s
tragic love-making.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Billy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You may as well
tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The room was very still. A rosebud
tapped twice against the window-pane. It
might have been a warning finger. Neither
noticed it. It tapped a third time.</p>
<p>Billy cleared his throat, and swallowed,
quickly.</p>
<p>Then he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man who made the blunder,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and fired the mine too soon; the man who
killed Lord Ingleby, by mistake, was the chap
you call &#8216;Jim Airth.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>JIM AIRTH DECIDES</h3>
</div>

<p>Lady Ingleby awaited Jim Airth&#8217;s
arrival, in her sitting-room.</p>
<p>As the hour drew near, she rang the bell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Groatley,&#8221; she said, when the butler
appeared, &#8220;the Earl of Airth, who was here
yesterday, will call again, this afternoon.
When his lordship comes, you can show him
in here. I shall not be at home to any one
else. You need not bring tea until I ring for
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she sat down, quietly waiting.</p>
<p>She had resumed the mourning, temporarily
laid aside. The black gown, hanging about
her in soft trailing folds, added to the graceful
height of her slight figure. The white tokens
of widowhood at neck and wrists gave to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
her unusual beauty a pathetic suggestion of
wistful loneliness. Her face was very pale; a
purple tint beneath the tired eyes betokened
tears and sleeplessness. But the calm steadfast
look in those sweet eyes revealed a mind
free of all doubt; a heart, completely at rest.</p>
<p>She leaned back among the sofa cushions,
her hands folded in her lap, and waited.</p>
<p>Bees hummed in and out of the open
windows. The scent of freesias filled the room,
delicate, piercingly sweet, yet not oppressive.
To one man forever afterwards the scent of
freesias recalled that afternoon; the exquisite
sweetness of that lovely face; the trailing
softness of her widow&#8217;s gown.</p>
<p>Steps in the hall.</p>
<p>The door opened. Groatley&#8217;s voice, pompously
sonorous, broke into the waiting
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Earl of Airth, m&#8217;lady&#8221;; and Jim
Airth walked in.</p>
<p>As the door closed behind him, Myra rose.</p>
<p>They stood, silently confronting one another
beneath Lord Ingleby&#8217;s picture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>It almost seemed as though the thoughtful
scholarly face must turn from its absorbed
contemplation of the little dog, to look down
for a moment upon them. They presented
a psychological problem&mdash;these brave hearts
in torment&mdash;which would surely have proved
interesting to the calm student of metaphysics.</p>
<p>Silently they faced one another for the space
of a dozen heart-beats.</p>
<p>Then Myra, with a swift movement, went
up to Jim Airth, put her arms about his neck,
and laid her head upon his breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>know</i>, my belovèd,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
need not give yourself the pain of trying to
tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; A single syllable seemed the most
Jim&#8217;s lips, for the moment, could manage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy told me. He and Ronald Ingram
came over yesterday afternoon, soon after
you left. They had passed you, on your way
to the station. They thought I ought to
know. So Billy told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth&#8217;s arms closed round her, holding
her tightly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My&mdash;poor&mdash;girl!&#8221; he said, brokenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They meant well, Jim. They are dear
boys. They knew you would come back and
tell me yourself; and they wanted to spare us
both that pain. I am glad they did it. You
were quite right when you said it had to be
faced alone. I could not have been ready for
your return, if I had not heard the truth, and
had time to face it alone. I <i>am</i> ready now,
Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth laid his cheek against her soft
hair, with a groan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come to say good-bye, Myra. It
is all that remains to be said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye?&#8221; Myra raised a face of terrified
questioning.</p>
<p>Jim Airth pressed it back to its hiding-place
upon his breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the man, Myra, whose hand you
could never bring yourself to touch in friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra lifted her head again. The look in
her eyes was that of a woman prepared to
fight for happiness and life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are the man,&#8221; she said, &#8220;whose little
finger is dearer to me than the whole body of
any one else has ever been. Do you suppose
I will give you up, Jim, because of a thing
which happened accidentally in the past,
before you and I had ever met? Ah, how little
you men understand a woman&#8217;s heart! Shall
I tell you what I felt when Billy told me,
after the first bewildering shock was over?
First: sorrow for you, my dearest; a realisation
of how appalling the mental anguish
must have been, at the time. Secondly:
thankfulness&mdash;yes, intense overwhelming
thankfulness&mdash;to know at last what had come
between us; and to know it was this thing&mdash;this
mere ghost out of the past&mdash;nothing
tangible or real; no wrong of mine against
you, or of yours against me; nothing which
need divide us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth slowly unlocked his arms, took her
by the wrists, holding her hands against his
breast. Then he looked into her eyes with a
silent sadness, more forcible than speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;My own poor girl,&#8221; he said, at length;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
&#8220;it is impossible for me to marry Lord Ingleby&#8217;s
widow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strength of his will mastered hers; and,
just as in Horseshoe Cove her fears had
yielded to his dauntless courage, so now
Myra felt her confidence ebbing away before
his stern resolve. Fearful of losing it altogether,
she drew away her hands, and turned
to the sofa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim,&#8221; she said, &#8220;sit down and let
us talk it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sank back among the cushions and
drawing a bowl of roses hastily toward her,
buried her face in them, fearing again to
meet the settled sadness of his eyes.</p>
<p>Jim Airth sat down&mdash;in the chair left
vacant by Lord Ingleby and Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, dear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I need not ask
you never to doubt my love. That would
be absurd from me to you. I love you as
I did not know it was possible for a man to
love a woman. I love you in such a way that
every fibre of my being will hunger for you
night and day&mdash;through all the years to come.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
But&mdash;well, it would always have come hard
to me to stand in another man&#8217;s shoes, and
take what had been his. I did not feel this
when I thought I was following Sergeant
O&#8217;Mara, because I knew he must always have
been in all things so utterly apart from you.
I could, under different circumstances, have
brought myself to follow Ingleby, because I
realise that he never awakened in you such
love as is yours for me. His possessions would
not have weighted me, because it so happens
I have lands and houses of my own, where we
could have lived. But, to stand in a dead
man&#8217;s shoes, when he is dead through an act
of mine; to take to myself another man&#8217;s
widow, when she would still, but for a reckless
movement of my own right hand, have been
a wife&mdash;Myra, I could not do it! Even with
our great love, it would not mean happiness.
Think of it&mdash;think! As we stood together in
the sight of God, while the Church, in solemn
voice, required and charged us both, as we
should answer at the dreadful day of judgment
when the secrets of all hearts should be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
disclosed, that if either of us knew any impediment
why we might not be lawfully
joined together in matrimony, we should then
confess it&mdash;I should cry: &#8216;Her husband died
by my hand!&#8217; and leave the church, with the
brand of Cain, and the infamy of David, upon
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra lifted frightened eyes; met his, beseechingly;
then bent again over the roses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or, even if I passed through that ordeal,
standing mute in the solemn silence, what of
the moment when the Church bade me take
your right hand in my right hand&mdash;Myra,
<i>my</i> right hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose, came swiftly over, and knelt
before him. She took his hand, and covered
it with tears and kisses. She held it, sobbing,
to her heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearest,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I will never ask you
to do, for my sake, anything you feel impossible
or wrong. But, oh, in this, I know
you are mistaken. I cannot argue or explain.
I cannot put my reasons into words. But
I <i>know</i> our living, longing, love <i>ought</i> to come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
before the happenings of a dead past. Michael
lost his life through an accident. That the
accident was caused by a mistake on your part,
is fearfully hard for you. But there is no
moral wrong in it. You might as well blame
the company whose boat took him abroad;
or the government which decided on the
expedition; or the War Office people, who
accepted him when he volunteered. I am
sure I don&#8217;t know what David did; I thought
he was a quite excellent person. But I <i>do</i>
know about Cain; and I am perfectly certain
that the brand of Cain could never rest on
anyone, because of an unpremeditated accident.
Oh, Jim! Cannot you look at it
reasonably?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I looked at it reasonably&mdash;after a while&mdash;until
yesterday,&#8221; said Jim Airth. &#8220;At first,
of course, all was blank, ghastly despair. Oh,
Myra, let me tell you! I have never been able
to tell anyone. Go back to the couch; I
can&#8217;t let you kneel here. Sit down over there,
and let me tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby rose at once and returned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
her seat; then sat listening&mdash;her yearning
eyes fixed upon his bowed head. He had
momentarily forgotten what the events of that
night had cost her; so also had she. Her only
thought was of his pain.</p>
<p>Jim Airth began to speak, in low, hurried
tones; haunted with a horror of reminiscence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see it now. The little stuffy tent;
the hidden light. I was already sickening for
fever, working with a temperature of 102. I
hadn&#8217;t slept for two nights, and my head felt
as if it were two large eyes, and those eyes,
both bruises. I knew I ought to knock under
and give the job to another man; but Ingleby
and I had worked it all out together, and I
was dead keen on it. It was a place where
no big guns could go; but our little arrangement
which you could carry in one hand,
would do better and surer work, than half a
dozen big guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a long wait after Ingleby and
the other fellow&mdash;it was Ingram&mdash;started.
Cathcart, left behind with me, was in and out
of the tent; but he couldn&#8217;t stay still two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
minutes; he was afraid of missing the rush.
So I was alone when the signal came. We
found afterwards that Ingram had crawled
out of the tunnel, and gone to take a message
to the nearest ambush. Ingleby was left
alone. He signalled: &#8216;Placed,&#8217; as agreed.
I took it to be &#8216;Fire!&#8217; and acted instantly.
The moment I had done it, I realised my
mistake. But that same instant came the
roar, and the hot silent night was turned to
pandemonium. I dashed out of the tent,
shouting for Ingleby. Good God! It was
like hell! The yelling swearing Tommies,
making up for the long enforced silence and
inaction; the hordes of dark devilish faces,
leering in their fury, and jeering at our discomfiture;
for inside their outer wall, was a
rampart of double the strength, and we were
no nearer taking Targai.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afterwards&mdash;if I hadn&#8217;t owned up at once
to my mistake, nobody would have known
how the thing had happened. Even then,
they tried to persuade me the wrong signal
had been given; but I knew better. And on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
the spot, it was impossible to find&mdash;well, any
actual proofs of what had happened. The
gap had been filled at once with crowds of
yelling jostling Tommies, mad to get into
the town. Jove, how those chaps fight when
they get the chance. When all was over,
several were missing who were not among the
dead. They must have forced themselves in
where they could not get back, and been taken
prisoners. God alone knows their fate, poor
beggars. Yet I envied them; for when the
row was over, my hell began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Myra, I would have given my whole life
to have had that minute over again. And it
was maddening to know that the business
might have been done all right with any old
fuse. Only we were so keen over our new
ideas for signalling, and our portable electric
apparatus. Oh, good Lord! I knew despair,
those days and nights! I was down with
fever, and they took away my sword, and
guns, and razors. I couldn&#8217;t imagine why.
Even despair doesn&#8217;t take me that way.
But if a chap could have come into my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
tent and said: &#8216;You didn&#8217;t kill Ingleby
after all. He&#8217;s all right and alive!&#8217; I would
have given my life gladly for that moment&#8217;s
relief. But no present anguish can undo
a past mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I pulled through the fever; life had
to be lived, and I suppose I&#8217;m not the sort of
chap to take a morbid view. When I found
the thing was to be kept quiet; when the few
who knew the ins-and-outs stood by me
like the good fellows they were, saying it
might have happened to any of them, and
as soon as I got fit again I should see the only
rotten thing would be to let it spoil my future;
I made up my mind to put it clean away, and
live it down. You know they say, out in the
great western country: &#8216;God Almighty hates
a quitter.&#8217; It is one of the stimulating tenets
of their fine practical theology. I had fought
through other hard times. I determined to
fight through this. I succeeded so well, that
it even seemed natural to go on with the
work Ingleby and I had been doing together,
and carry it through. And when notes of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
his were needed, I came to his own home
without a qualm, to ask his widow&mdash;the
woman I, by my mistake, had widowed&mdash;for
permission to have and to use them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came&mdash;my mind full of the rich joy of
life and love, with scarcely room for a passing
pang of regret, as I entered the house without
a master, the home without a head, knowing
I was about to meet the woman I had widowed.
Truly &#8216;The mills of God grind slowly, but they
grind exceeding small.&#8217; I had thrown off too
easily what should have been a lifelong burden
of regret.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the woman I had widowed I found&mdash;the
woman I was about to wed! Good God!
Was there ever so hard a retribution?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Myra, gently, &#8220;is there not
another side to the picture? Does it not strike
you that it should have seemed beautiful to
find that God in His wonderful providence
had put you in a position to be able to take
care of Michael&#8217;s widow, left so helpless and
alone; that in saving her life by the strength
of your right hand, you had atoned for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
death that hand had unwittingly dealt; that,
though the past cannot be undone, it can
sometimes be wiped out by the present?
Oh, Jim! Cannot you see it thus, and keep
and hold the right to take care of me forever?
My belovèd! Let us never, from this moment,
part. I will come away with you at once.
We can get a special licence, and be married
immediately. We will let Shenstone, and let
the house in Park Lane, and live abroad, anywhere
you will, Jim; only together&mdash;together!
Take me away to-day. Maggie O&#8217;Mara can
attend me, until we are married. But I
can&#8217;t face life without you. Jim&mdash;I can&#8217;t!
God knows, I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth looked up, a gleam of hope in his
sad eyes.</p>
<p>Then he looked away, that her appealing
loveliness might not too much tempt him,
while making his decision. He lifted his eyes;
and, alas! they fell on the portrait over the
mantelpiece.</p>
<p>He shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can never marry Lord Ingleby&#8217;s widow,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
he said. &#8220;Myra, how can you wish it? The
thing would haunt us! It would be evil&mdash;unnatural.
Night and day, it would be there.
It would come between us. Some day you
would reproach me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, hush!&#8221; cried Myra, sharply. &#8220;Not
that! I am suffering enough. At least spare
me that!&#8221; Then, putting aside once more
her own pain: &#8220;Would it not be happiness
to you, Jim?&#8221; she asked, with wistful
gentleness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happiness?&#8221; cried Jim Airth, violently,
&#8220;It would be hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby rose, her face as white as
the large arum lily in the corner behind
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that settles it,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and, do
you know, I think we had better not speak of
it any more. I am going to ring for tea.
And, if you will excuse me for a few moments,
while they are bringing it, I will search among
my husband&#8217;s papers, and try to find those
you require for your book.&#8221;</p>
<p>She passed swiftly out. Through the closed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
door, the man she left alone heard her giving
quiet orders in the hall.</p>
<p>He crossed the room, in two great strides, to
follow her. But at the door he paused; turned,
and came slowly back.</p>
<p>He stood on the hearthrug, with bent head;
rigid, motionless.</p>
<p>Suddenly he lifted his eyes to Lord Ingleby&#8217;s
portrait.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse you!&#8221; he said through clenched
teeth, and beat his fists upon the marble
mantelpiece. &#8220;Curse your explosives! And
curse your inventions! And curse you for
taking her first!&#8221; Then he dropped into a
chair, and buried his face in his hands. &#8220;Oh,
God forgive me!&#8221; he whispered, brokenly.
&#8220;But there is a limit to what a man can bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>He scarcely noticed the entrance of the footman
who brought tea. But when a lighter
step paused at the door, he lifted a haggard
face, expecting to see Myra.</p>
<p>A quiet woman entered, simply dressed in
black merino. Her white linen collar and
cuffs gave her the look of a hospital nurse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
Her dark hair, neatly parted, was smoothly
coiled around her head. She came in, deferentially;
yet with a quiet dignity of manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come to pour your tea, my lord,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Lady Ingleby is not well, and
fears she must remain in her room. She
asks me to give you these papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the Earl of Airth and Monteith rose
to his feet, and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you must be Mrs. O&#8217;Mara,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I am glad to meet you, and it is kind
of you to give me tea. I have heard of you
before; and I believe I saw you yesterday, on
the steps of your pretty house, as I drove up
the avenue. Will you allow me to tell you
how often, when we stood shoulder to shoulder
in times of difficulty and danger, I had reason
to respect and admire the brave comrade I
knew as Sergeant O&#8217;Mara?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Before quitting Shenstone, Jim Airth sat at
Myra&#8217;s davenport and wrote a letter, leaving it
with Mrs. O&#8217;Mara to place in Lady Ingleby&#8217;s
hands as soon as he had gone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do not wonder you felt unable to see me
again. Forgive me for all the grief I have
caused, and am causing, you. I shall go
abroad as soon as may be; but am obliged to
remain in town until I have completed work
which I am under contract with my publishers
to finish. It will take a month, at most.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want me, Myra&mdash;I mean if you
<i>need</i> me&mdash;I could come at any moment. A
wire to my Club would always find me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>A BETTER POINT OF VIEW</h3>
</div>

<p>In the days which followed, Jim Airth suffered
all the pangs which come to a man who
has made a decision prompted by pride rather
than by conviction.</p>
<p>It had always seemed to him essential that
a man should appear in all things without
shame or blame in the eyes of the woman he
loved. Therefore, to be obliged suddenly to
admit that a fatal blunder of his own had
been the cause, even in the past, of irreparable
loss and sorrow to her, had been an unacknowledged
but intolerable humiliation. That she
should have anything to overlook or to forgive
in accepting himself and his love, was a condition
of things to which he could not bring
himself to submit; and her sweet generosity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
and devotion, rather increased than soothed
his sense of wounded pride.</p>
<p>He had been superficially honest in the
reasons he had given to Myra regarding the
impossibility of marriage between them. He
had said all the things which he knew others
might be expected to say; he had mercilessly
expressed what would have been his own
judgment had he been asked to pronounce
an opinion concerning any other man and
woman in like circumstances. As he voiced
them they had sounded tragically plausible
and stoically just. He knew he was inflicting
almost unbearable pain upon himself and upon
the woman whose whole love was his; but that
pain seemed necessary to the tragic demands
of the entire ghastly situation.</p>
<p>Only after he had finally left her and was on
his way back to town, did Jim Airth realise
that the pain he had thus inflicted upon her
and upon himself, had been a solace to his
own wounded pride. His had been the
mistake, and it re-established him in his own
self-respect and sense of superiority, that his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
should be the decision, so hard to make&mdash;so
unfalteringly made&mdash;bringing down upon
his own head a punishment out of all proportion
to the fault committed.</p>
<p>But, now that the strain and tension were
over, his natural honesty of mind reasserted
itself, forcing him to admit that his own selfish
pride had been at the bottom of his high-flown
tragedy.</p>
<p>Myra&#8217;s simple loving view of the case had
been the right one; yet, thrusting it from him,
he had ruthlessly plunged himself and her into
a hopeless abyss of needless suffering.</p>
<p>By degrees he slowly realised that in so
doing he had deliberately inflicted a more cruel
wrong upon the woman he loved, than that
which he had unwittingly done her in the past.</p>
<p>Remorse and regret gnawed at his heart,
added to an almost unbearable hunger for
Myra. Yet he could not bring himself to
return to her with this second and still more
humiliating confession of failure.</p>
<p>His one hope was that Myra would find
their separation impossible to endure, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
would send for him. But the days went by,
and Myra made no sign. She had said she
would never send for him unless assured
that coming to her would mean happiness
to him. To this decision she quietly adhered.</p>
<p>In a strongly virile man, love towards a
woman is, in its essential qualities, naturally
selfish. Its keynote is, &#8220;I need&#8221;; its dominant,
&#8220;I want&#8221;; its full major chord, &#8220;I must
possess.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the woman&#8217;s love for the
man is essentially unselfish. Its keynote is,
&#8220;He needs&#8221;; its dominant, &#8220;I am his, to do
with as he pleases&#8221;; its full major chord,
&#8220;Let me give all.&#8221; In the Book of Canticles,
one of the greatest love-poems ever written,
we find this truth exemplified; we see the
woman&#8217;s heart learning its lesson, in a fine
crescendo of self-surrender. In the first stanza
she says: &#8220;My Belovèd is mine, and I am
his&#8221;; in the second, &#8220;I am my Belovèd&#8217;s and
he is mine.&#8221; But in the third, all else is
merged in the instinctive joy of giving: &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
am my Belovèd&#8217;s, and his desire is towards
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the natural attitude of the sexes,
designed by an all-wise Creator; but designed
for a condition of ideal perfection. No
perfect law could be framed for imperfection.
Therefore, if the working out prove often a
failure, the fault lies in the imperfection of
the workers, not in the perfection of the law.
In those rare cases where the love is ideal, the
man&#8217;s &#8220;I take&#8221; and the woman&#8217;s &#8220;I give&#8221;
blend into an ideal union, each completing
and modifying the other. But where sin of
any kind comes in, a false note has been
struck in the divine harmony, and the grand
chord of mutual love fails to ring true.</p>
<p>Into their perfect love, Jim Airth had introduced
the discord of false pride. It had
become the basis of his line of action, and their
symphony of life, so beautiful at first in its
sweet theme of mutual love and trust, now lost
its harmony, and jarred into a hopeless jangle.
The very fact that she faithfully adhered to
her trustful unselfishness, acquiescing without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
a murmur in his decision, made readjustment
the more impossible. Thus the weeks
went by.</p>
<p>Jim Airth worked feverishly at his proofs;
drinking and smoking, when he should have
been eating and sleeping; going off suddenly,
after two or three days of continuous sitting
at his desk, on desperate bouts of violent
exercise.</p>
<p>He walked down to Shenstone by night;
sat, in bitterness of spirit under the beeches,
surrounded by empty wicker chairs;&mdash;a silent
ghostly garden-party!&mdash;watched the dawn
break over the lake; prowled around the house
where Lady Ingleby lay sleeping, and narrowly
escaped arrest at the hands of Lady Ingleby&#8217;s
night-watchman; leaving for London by the
first train in the morning, more sick at heart
than when he started.</p>
<p>Another time he suddenly turned in at
Paddington, took the train down to Cornwall,
and astonished the Miss Murgatroyds by
stalking into the coffee-room, the gaunt
ghost of his old gay self. Afterwards he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
went off to Horseshoe Cove, climbed the
cliff and spent the night on the ledge,
dwelling in morbid misery on the wonderful
memories with which that place was surrounded.</p>
<p>It was then that fresh hope, and the complete
acceptance of a better point of view,
came to Jim Airth.</p>
<p>As he sat on the ledge, hugging his lonely
misery, he suddenly became strangely conscious
of Myra&#8217;s presence. It was as if the
sweet wistful grey eyes, were turned upon
him in the darkness; the tender mouth smiled
lovingly, while the voice he knew so well asked
in soft merriment, as under the beeches at
Shenstone: &#8220;What has come to you, you
dearest old boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had just put his hand into his pocket
and drawn out his spirit-flask. He held it for
a moment, while he listened, spellbound, to
that whisper; then flung it away into the
darkness, far down to the sea below. &#8220;Davy
Jones may have it,&#8221; he said, and laughed aloud;
&#8220;<i>who e&#8217;er he be!</i>&#8221; It was the first time Jim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
Airth had laughed since that afternoon beneath
the Shenstone beeches.</p>
<p>Then, with the sense of Myra&#8217;s presence
still so near him, he lay with his back to the
cliff, his face to the moonlit sea. It seemed
to him as if again he drew her, shaking and
trembling but unresisting, into his arms, holding
her there in safety until her trembling
ceased, and she slept the untroubled sleep of a
happy child.</p>
<p>All the best and noblest in Jim Airth awoke
at that hallowed memory of faithful strength
on his part, and trustful peace on hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what a nightmare
it has been! And what a fool, I, to think
anything could come between us. Has she
not been utterly mine since that sacred night
spent here? And I have left her to loneliness
and grief?.... I will arise and go to my
belovèd. No past, no shame, no pride of
mine, shall come between us any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised himself on his elbow and looked
over the edge. The moonlight shone on
rippling water lapping the foot of the cliff.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
He could see his watch by its bright light.
Midnight! He must wait until three, for the
tide to go down. He leaned back again, his
arms folded across his chest; but Myra was
still safely within them.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, Jim Airth slept soundly.</p>
<p>The dawn awoke him. He scrambled down
to the shore, and once again swam up the
golden path toward the rising sun.</p>
<p>As he got back into his clothes, it seemed
to him that every vestige of that black nightmare
had been left behind in the gay tossing
waters.</p>
<p>On his way to the railway station, he passed
a farm. The farmer&#8217;s wife had been up since
sunrise, churning. She gladly gave him a
simple breakfast of home-made bread, with
butter fresh from the churn.</p>
<p>He caught the six o&#8217;clock express for town;
tubbed, shaved, and lunched, at his Club.</p>
<p>At a quarter to three he was just coming
down the steps into Piccadilly, very consciously
&#8220;clothed and in his right mind,&#8221; debating
which train he could take for Shenstone if&mdash;as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
in duty bound&mdash;he looked in at his publishers&#8217;
first; when a telegraph boy dashed
up the steps into the Club, and the next
moment the hall-porter hastened after him
with a telegram.</p>
<p>Jim Airth read it; took one look at his watch;
then jumped headlong into a passing taxicab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charing Cross!&#8221; he shouted to the
chauffeur. &#8220;And a sovereign if you do it in
five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the flag tinged down, and the taxi
glided swiftly forward into the whirl of traffic,
Jim Airth unfolded the telegram and read it
again.</p>
<p>It had been handed in at Shenstone at 2.15.</p>

<p>A shout of exultation arose within him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>MICHAEL VERITAS</h3>
</div>

<p>On the morning of that day, while Jim
Airth, braced with a new resolve and a
fresh outlook on life, was speeding up from
Cornwall, Lady Ingleby sat beneath the
scarlet chestnuts, watching Ronald and Billy
play tennis.</p>
<p>They had entered for a tournament, and discovered
that they required constant practice
such as, apparently, could only be obtained
at Shenstone. In reality they came over
so frequently in honest-hearted trouble and
anxiety over their friend, of whose unexpected
sorrow they chanced to be the sole confidants.
Lady Ingleby refused herself to all other
visitors. In the trying uncertainty of these
few weeks while Jim Airth was still in England,
she dreaded questions or comments. To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
Jane Dalmain she had written the whole truth.
The Dalmains were at Worcester, attending
a musical festival in that noblest of English
cathedrals; but they expected soon to return
to Overdene, when Jane had promised to come
to her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ronald and Billy turned up
often, doing their valiant best to be cheerful;
but Myra&#8217;s fragile look, and large pathetic eyes,
alarmed and horrified them. Obviously things
had gone more hopelessly wrong than they
had anticipated. They had known at once
that Airth would not marry Lady Ingleby;
but it had never occurred to them that Lady
Ingleby would still wish to marry Airth.
Ronald stoutly denied that this was the case;
but Billy affirmed it, though refusing to give
reasons.</p>
<p>Ronald had never succeeded in extorting
from Billy one word of what had taken place
when he had told Lady Ingleby that Jim
Airth was the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wanted to know how she took it,
you should have told her yourself,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
Billy. &#8220;And it will be a saving of useless
trouble, Ron, if you never ask me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the days went by; and, though she
always seemed gently pleased to see them
both, no possible opening had been given
to Ronald for assuming the rôle of manly
comforter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall give it up,&#8221; said Ronnie at last, in
bitterness of spirit; &#8220;I tell you, I shall give
it up; and marry the duchess!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be profane,&#8221; counselled Billy. &#8220;It
would be more to the point to find Airth, and
explain to him, in carefully chosen language,
that letting Lady Ingleby die of a broken
heart will not atone for blowing up her husband.
I always knew our news would make
no difference, from the moment I saw her go
quite pink when she told us his name. She
never went pink over Ingleby, you bet! I
didn&#8217;t know they could do it, after twenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much you know, then!&#8221; ejaculated Ronnie,
scornfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the duchess go
pink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scarlet, you mean,&#8221; amended Billy. &#8220;So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
have I, old chap; but that&#8217;s another pair o&#8217;
boots, as you very well know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be vulgar,&#8221; sighed Ronnie,
wearily. &#8220;Let&#8217;s cut the whole thing and go
to town. Henley begins to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>But next day they turned up at Shenstone,
earlier than usual.</p>
<p>And that morning, Lady Ingleby was feeling
strangely restful and at peace; not with any
expectations of future happiness; but resigned
to the inevitable; and less apart from Jim
Airth. She had fallen asleep the night before
beset by haunting memories of Cornwall and
of their climb up the cliff. At midnight she
had awakened with a start, fancying herself on
the ledge, and feeling that she was falling.
But instantly Jim Airth&#8217;s arms seemed to enfold
her; she felt herself drawn into safety;
then that exquisite sense of strength and rest
was hers once more.</p>
<p>So vivid had been the dream, that its effect
remained with her when she rose. Thus she
sat watching the tennis with a little smile of
content on her sweet face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She is beginning to forget,&#8221; thought
Ronnie, exultant. &#8220;<i>My</i> &#8217;vantage!&#8221; he shouted
significantly to Billy, over the net.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deuce!&#8221; responded Billy, smashing down
the ball with unnecessary violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; cried Ronnie. &#8220;Outside, my boy!
Game and a &#8216;love&#8217; set to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay to lunch, boys,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby,
as the gong sounded; and they all three went
gaily into the house.</p>
<p>As they passed through the hall afterwards,
their motor stood at the door; so they bade
her good-bye, and turned to find their rackets.</p>
<p>At that moment they heard the sharp ting
of a bicycle bell. A boy had ridden up with
a telegram. Groatley, waiting to see them
off, took it; picked up a silver salver from the
hall table, and followed Lady Ingleby to her
sitting-room.</p>
<p>There seemed so sudden a silence in the
house, that Ronald and Billy with one accord
stood listening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty minutes to two,&#8221; said Billy,
glancing at the clock. &#8220;Spirits are walking.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>The next moment a cry rang out from Lady
Ingleby&#8217;s sitting-room&mdash;a cry of such mingled
bewilderment, wonder, and relief, that they
looked at one another in amazement. Then
without waiting to question or consider, they
hastened to her.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby was standing in the middle
of the room, an open telegram in her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she was saying; &#8220;Oh, Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was so transfigured by thankfulness
and joy, that neither Ronald nor Billy could
frame a question. They merely gazed at
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy! Oh, Ronald!&#8221; she said, &#8220;<i>He
didn&#8217;t do it!</i> Oh think what this will mean
to Jim Airth. Stop the boy! Quick! Bring
me a telegram form. I must send for him at
once.... Oh, Jim, Jim!.... He said he
would give his life for the relief of the moment
when some one should step into the tent and
tell him he had not done it; and now I shall
be that &#8216;some one&#8217;!.... Oh, <i>how</i> do you
spell &#8216;Piccadilly&#8217;.... Please call Groatley.
If we lose no time, he may catch the three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
o&#8217;clock express.... Groatley, tell the boy
to take this telegram and have it sent off
immediately. Give him half-a-crown, and say
he may keep the change.... Now boys.... Shut
the door!&#8221;</p>
<p>The whirlwind of excitement was succeeded
by sudden stillness. Lady Ingleby sank upon
the sofa, burying her face for a moment in the
cushions.</p>
<p>In the silence they heard the telegraph
boy disappearing rapidly into the distance,
ringing his bell a very unnecessary number
of times. When it could be heard no longer,
Lady Ingleby lifted her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael is alive,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scot!&#8221; exclaimed Ronnie, and took
a step forward.</p>
<p>Billy made no sound, but he turned very
white; backed to the door, and leaned against
it for support.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think what it means to Jim Airth!&#8221;
said Lady Ingleby. &#8220;Think of the despair
and misery through which he passed; and, after
all, he had not done it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;May we see?&#8221; asked Ronald eagerly,
holding out his hand for the telegram.</p>
<p>Billy licked his dry lips, but no sound would
come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read it,&#8221; said Myra.</p>
<p>Ronald took the telegram and read it aloud.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<i>To Lady Ingleby, Shenstone Park, Shenstone, England.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Reported death a mistake. Taken prisoner
Targai. Escaped. Arrived Cairo. Large
bribes and rewards to pay. Cable five hundred
pounds to Cook&#8217;s immediately.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Michael Veritas.</i>&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Great Scot!&#8221; said Ronnie again.</p>
<p>Billy said nothing; but his eyes never left
Lady Ingleby&#8217;s radiant face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think what it will mean to Jim Airth,&#8221;
she repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;yes,&#8221; said Ronnie. &#8220;It considerably
changes the situation&mdash;for him. What does
&#8216;Veritas&#8217; mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; replied Lady Ingleby &#8220;is our
private code, Michael&#8217;s and mine. My mother
once wired to me in Michael&#8217;s name, and to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
Michael in mine&mdash;dear mamma occasionally
does eccentric things&mdash;and it made complications.
Michael was very much annoyed;
and after that we took to signing our telegrams
&#8216;Veritas,&#8217; which means: &#8216;This is really from
me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think!&#8221; said Ronnie. &#8220;He, a prisoner;
and we, all marching away! But I remember
now, we always suspected prisoners had
been taken at Targai. And positive proofs of
Lord Ingleby&#8217;s death were difficult to&mdash;well,
don&#8217;t you know&mdash;to find. I mean&mdash;there
couldn&#8217;t be a funeral. We had to conclude
it, because we believed him to have been
right inside the tunnel. He must have got
clear after all, before Airth sent the flash, and
getting in with the first rush, been unable to
return. Of course he has reached Cairo with
no money and no means of getting home.
And the chaps who helped him, will stick to
him like leeches till they get their pay. What
shall you do about cabling?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby seemed to collect her thoughts
with difficulty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course the money must be sent&mdash;and
sent at once,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, Ronnie, <i>could</i>
you go up to town about it, for me? I would
give you a cheque, and a note to my bankers;
they will know how to cable it through.
Could you, Ronnie? Michael must not be
kept waiting; yet I must stay here to tell Jim.
It never struck me that I might have gone
up to town myself; and now I have wired to
Jim to come down here. Oh, my dear Ronnie,
could you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I could,&#8221; said Ronald, cheerfully.
&#8220;The motor is at the door. I can catch the
two-thirty, if you write the note at once.
No need for a cheque. Just write a few lines
authorising your bankers to send out the
money; I will see them personally; explain the
whole thing, and hurry them up. The money
shall be in Cairo to-night, if possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby went to her davenport.</p>
<p>No sound broke the stillness save the rapid
scratching of her pen.</p>
<p>Then Billy spoke. &#8220;I will come with you,&#8221;
he said, hoarsely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why do that?&#8221; objected Ronald. &#8220;You
may as well go on in the motor to Overdene,
and tell them there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to town,&#8221; said Billy, decidedly.
Then he walked over to where the telegram
still lay on the table. &#8220;May I copy this?&#8221;
he asked of Lady Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; she said, without looking round.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Ronnie&mdash;you take the original to
show them at the bank. Ah, no! I must
keep that for Jim. Here is paper. Make
two copies, Billy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy had already copied the message into
his pocket-book. With shaking fingers he
copied it again, handing the sheet to Ronald,
without looking at him.</p>
<p>The note written, Lady Ingleby rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Ronald,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Thank
you, more than I can say. I think you will
catch the train. And good-bye, Billy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Billy was already in the motor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>LORD INGLEBY&#8217;S WIFE</h3>
</div>

<p>The journey down from town had been as
satisfactorily rapid as even Jim Airth
could desire. He had caught the train at
Charing Cross by five seconds.</p>
<p>The hour&#8217;s run passed quickly in glowing
anticipation of that which was being brought
nearer by every turn of the wheels.</p>
<p>Myra&#8217;s telegram was drawn from his pocket-book
many times. Each word seemed fraught
with tender meaning, &#8220;<i>Come to me at once.</i>&#8221;
It was so exactly Myra&#8217;s simple direct method
of expression. Most people would have said,
&#8220;Come here,&#8221; or &#8220;Come to Shenstone,&#8221; or
merely &#8220;Come.&#8221; &#8220;Come <i>to me</i>&#8221; seemed a
tender, though unconscious, response to his
resolution of the night before: &#8220;I will arise and
go to my belovèd.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>Now that the parting was nearly over, he
realised how terrible had been the blank of
three weeks spent apart from Myra. Her
sweet personality was so knit into his life,
that he needed her&mdash;not at any particular
time, or in any particular way&mdash;but always;
as the air he breathed; or as the light, which
made the day.</p>
<p>And she? He drew a well-worn letter from
his pocket-book&mdash;the only letter he had ever
had from Myra.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall always want you,&#8221; it said; &#8220;but I
could never send, unless the coming would
mean happiness for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet she <i>had</i> sent. Then she had happiness
in store for him. Had she instinctively
realised his change of mind? Or had she
gauged his desperate hunger by her own, and
understood that the satisfying of that, <i>must</i>
mean happiness, whatever else of sorrow might
lie in the background?</p>
<p>But there should be no background of
anything but perfect joy, when Myra was
his wife. Would he not have the turning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
of the fair leaves of her book of life? Each
page should unfold fresh happiness, hold
new surprises as to what life and love
could mean. He would know how to guard
her from the faintest shadow of disillusion.
Even now it was his right to keep her from
that. How much, after all, should he tell
her of the heart-searchings of these wretched
weeks? Last night he had meant to tell her
everything; he had meant to say: &#8220;I have
sinned against heaven&mdash;the heaven of our
love&mdash;and before thee; and am no more
worthy....&#8221; But was it not essential to a
woman&#8217;s happiness to believe the man she
loved, to be in all ways, worthy? Out of his
pocket came again the well-worn letter. &#8220;I
know you decided as you felt right,&#8221; wrote
Myra. Why perplex her with explanations?
Let the dead past bury its dead. No need
to cloud, even momentarily, the joy with which
they could now go forward into a new
life. And what a life! Wedded life with
Myra&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shenstone Junction!&#8221; shouted a porter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
and Jim Airth was across the platform before
the train had stopped.</p>
<p>The tandem ponies waited outside the station,
and this time Jim Airth gathered up the
reins with a gay smile, flicking the leader,
lightly. Before, he had said: &#8220;I never drive
other people&#8217;s ponies,&#8221; in response to &#8220;Her
ladyship&#8217;s&#8221; message; but now&mdash;&#8220;All that&#8217;s
mine, is thine, laddie.&#8221;</p>
<p>He whistled &#8220;Huntingtower,&#8221; as he drove
between the hayfields. Sprays of overhanging
traveller&#8217;s-joy brushed his shoulder in the
narrow lanes. It was good to be alive on
such a day. It was good not to be leaving
England, in England&#8217;s most perfect weather.... Should
he take her home to Scotland
for their honeymoon, or down to Cornwall?</p>
<p>What a jolly little church!</p>
<p>Evidently Myra never slacked pace for a
gate. How the ponies dashed through, and
into the avenue!</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. O&#8217;Mara! It had been difficult
to be civil to her, when she had appeared instead
of Myra to give him tea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>Of course Scotland would be jolly, with so
much to show her; but Cornwall meant more,
in its associations. Yes; he would arrange
for the honeymoon in Cornwall; be married in
the morning, up in town; no fuss; then go
straight down to the old Moorhead Inn. And
after dinner, they would sit in the honeysuckle
arbour, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Groatley showed him into Myra&#8217;s sitting-room.</p>
<p>She was not there.</p>
<p>He walked over to the mantelpiece. It
seemed years since that evening when, in a
sudden fury against Fate, he had crashed his
fists upon its marble edge. He raised his eyes
to Lord Ingleby&#8217;s portrait. Poor old chap!
He looked so content, and so pleased with
himself, and his little dog. But he must have
always appeared more like Myra&#8217;s father than
her&mdash;than anything else.</p>
<p>On the mantelpiece lay a telegram. After
the manner of leisurely country post-offices,
the full address was written on the envelope.
It caught Jim Airth&#8217;s eye, and hardly conscious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
of doing so, he took it up and read it.
&#8220;<i>Lady Ingleby, Shenstone Park, England.</i>&#8221;
He laid it down. &#8220;England?&#8221; he wondered,
idly. &#8220;Who can have been wiring to her
from abroad?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he turned. He had not heard her
enter; but she was standing behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Myra!&#8221; he cried, and caught her to his
heart.</p>
<p>The rapture and relief of that moment were
unspeakable. No words seemed possible.
He could only strain her to him, silently, with
all his strength, and realise that she was
safely there at last.</p>
<p>Myra had lifted her arms, and laid them
lightly about his neck, hiding her face upon
his breast.... He never knew exactly when
he began to realise a subtle change about the
quality of her embrace; the woman&#8217;s passionate
tenderness seemed missing; it rather
resembled the trustful clinging of a little child.
An uneasy foreboding, for which he could not
account, assailed Jim Airth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiss me, Myra!&#8221; he said, peremptorily,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
and she, lifting her sweet face to his, kissed
him at once. But it was the pure loving kiss
of a little child.</p>
<p>Then she withdrew herself from his embrace;
and, standing back, he looked at her, perplexed.
The light upon her face seemed
hardly earthly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim,&#8221; she said, &#8220;God&#8217;s ways are wonderful!
I have such news for you, my friend.
I thank God, it came before you had gone
beyond recall. And I, who had been the
one, unwittingly, to add so terribly to the
weight of the lifelong cross you had to bear,
am privileged to be the one to lift it quite
away. Jim&mdash;<i>you did not do it!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth gazed at her in troubled amazement.
Into his mind, involuntarily, came the
awesome Scotch word &#8220;fey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not do what, dear?&#8221; he asked,
gently, as if he were speaking to a little child
whom he was anxious not to frighten.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not kill Michael.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think I did not kill
Michael, dear?&#8221; questioned Jim Airth, gently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Myra, with clasped hands,
&#8220;Michael is alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearest heart,&#8221; said Jim Airth, tenderly,
&#8220;you are not well. These awful three weeks,
and what went before, have been too much for
you. The strain has upset you. I was a
brute to go off and leave you. But you
knew I did what I thought right at the time;
didn&#8217;t you, Myra? Only now I see the whole
thing quite differently. Your view was the
true one. We ought to have acted upon it,
and been married at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim,&#8221; said Myra, &#8220;thank God we
didn&#8217;t! It would have been so terrible now.
It must have been a case of &#8216;Even there shall
Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand shall
hold me.&#8217; In our unconscious ignorance, we
might have gone away together, not knowing
Michael was alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beads of perspiration stood on Jim Airth&#8217;s
forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;My darling, you are ill,&#8221; he said, in a voice
of agonised anxiety. &#8220;I am afraid you are
very ill. Do sit down quietly on the couch,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
and let me ring. I must speak to the O&#8217;Mara
woman, or somebody. Why didn&#8217;t the fools
let me know? Have you been ill all these
weeks?&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra let him place her on the couch;
smiling up at him reassuringly, as he stood
before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not ring the bell, Jim,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Maggie is at the Lodge; and Groatley would
be so astonished. I am quite well.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked around, in man-like helplessness;
yet feeling something must be done. A long
ivory fan, of exquisite workmanship, lay on a
table near. He caught it up, and handed it
to her. She took it; and to please him,
opened it, fanning herself gently as she talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not ill, Jim; really dear, I am not.
I am only strangely happy and thankful. It
seems too wonderful for our poor earthly hearts
to understand. And I am a little frightened
about the future&mdash;but you will help me to
face that, I know. And I am rather worried
about little things I have done wrong. It
seems foolish&mdash;but as soon as I realised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
Michael was coming home, I became conscious
of hosts of sins of omission, and I scarcely
know where to begin to set them right. And
the worst of all is&mdash;Jim! we have lost little
Peter&#8217;s grave! No one seems able to locate
it. It is so trying of the gardeners; and so
wrong of me; because of course I ought to
have planted it with flowers. And Michael
would have expected a little marble slab, by
now. But I, stupidly, was too ill to see to the
funeral; and now Anson declares they put
him in the plantation, and George swears it
was in the shrubbery. I have been consulting
Groatley who always has ideas, and expresses
them so well, and he says: &#8216;Choose a suitable
spot, m&#8217; lady; order a handsome tomb; plant
it with choice flowers; and who&#8217;s to be the
wiser, till the resurrection?&#8217; Groatley is
always resourceful; but of course I never
deceive Michael. Fancy little Peter rising
from the shrubbery, when Michael had
mourned for years over a marble tomb on the
lawn! But it really is a great worry. They
must all begin digging, and keep on until they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
find something definite. It will be good for
the shrubbery and the plantation, like the silly
old man in the parable&mdash;no, I mean fable&mdash;who
pretended he had hidden a treasure. Oh,
Jim, don&#8217;t look so distressed. I ought not
to pour out all these trivial things to you;
but since I have known Michael is coming
back, my mind seems to have become foolish
and trivial again. Michael always has that
effect upon me; because&mdash;though he himself
is so great and clever&mdash;he really thinks trivial
and unimportant things are a woman&#8217;s vocation
in life. But oh, Jim&mdash;Jim Airth&mdash;with
<i>you</i> I am always lifted straight to the big
things; and our big thing to-day is this:&mdash;that
you never killed Michael. Do you remember
telling me how, as you lay in your tent recovering
from the fever, if some one could have come
in and told you Michael was alive and well,
and that you had not killed him after all, you
would have given your life for the relief of that
moment? Well, <i>I</i> am that &#8216;some one,&#8217; and
<i>this</i> is the &#8216;moment&#8217;; and when first I had the
telegram I could think of nothing&mdash;absolutely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
nothing, Jim&mdash;but what it would be to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What telegram?&#8221; gasped Jim Airth. &#8220;In
heaven&#8217;s name, Myra, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael&#8217;s telegram. It lies on the mantelpiece.
Read it, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth turned, took up the telegram and
drew it from the envelope with steady fingers.
He still thought Myra was raving.</p>
<p>He read it through, slowly. The wording
was unmistakable; but he read it through
again. As he did so he slightly turned, so
that his back was toward the couch.</p>
<p>The blow was so stupendous. He could
only realise one thing, for the moment:&mdash;that
the woman who watched him read it,
must not as yet see his face.</p>
<p>She spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not almost impossible to believe,
Jim? Ronald and Billy were lunching here,
when it came. Billy seemed stunned; but Ronnie
was delighted. He said he had always
believed the first men to rush in had been
captured, and that no actual proofs of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
Michael&#8217;s death had ever been found. They
never explained to me before, that there
had been no funeral. I suppose they thought
it would seem more horrible. But I
never take much account of bodies. If it
weren&#8217;t for the burden of having a weird
little urn about, and wondering what to
do with it, I should approve of cremation.
I sometimes felt I ought to make a pilgrimage
to see the grave. I knew Michael would have
wished it. He sets much store by graves&mdash;all
the Inglebys lie in family vaults. That
makes it worse about Peter. Ronnie went up
to town at once to telegraph out the money.
Billy went with him. Do you think five
hundred is enough? Jim?&mdash;Jim! Are you
not thankful? Do say something, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth put back the telegram upon the
mantelpiece. His big hand shook.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is &#8216;Veritas&#8217;?&#8221; he asked, without
looking round.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is our private code, Jim; Michael&#8217;s
and mine. My mother once wired to me in
Michael&#8217;s name, and to him in mine&mdash;poor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
mamma often does eccentric things, to get
her own way&mdash;and it made complications,
Michael was very much annoyed. So we
settled always to sign important telegrams
&#8216;Veritas,&#8217; which means: &#8216;This is really from
me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;your husband&mdash;is coming home
to you?&#8221; said Jim Airth, slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Jim,&#8221; the sweet voice faltered, for
the first time, and grew tremulous. &#8220;Michael
is coming home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Jim Airth turned round, and faced her
squarely. Myra had never seen anything so
terrible as his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mine,&#8221; he said; &#8220;not his.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra looked up at him, in dumb sorrowful
appeal. She closed the ivory fan, clasping her
hands upon it. The unquestioning finality of
her patient silence, goaded Jim Airth to madness,
and let loose the torrent of his fierce
wild protest against this inevitable&mdash;this
unrelenting, fate.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mine,&#8221; he said, &#8220;not his. Your
love is mine! Your body is mine! Your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
whole life is mine! I will not leave you to
another man. Ah, I know I said we could
not marry! I know I said I should go abroad.
But you would have remained faithful to me;
and I, to you. We might have been apart;
we might have been lonely; we might have
been at different ends of the earth; but&mdash;we
should have been each other&#8217;s. I could have
left you to loneliness; but, by God, I will not
leave you to another!&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra rose, moved forward a few steps and
stood, leaning her arm upon the mantelpiece
and looking down upon the bank of ferns and
lilies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Jim,&#8221; she said, gently. &#8220;You forget
to whom you are speaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am speaking,&#8221; cried Jim Airth, in furious
desperation, &#8220;to the woman I have won for
my own; and who is mine, and none other&#8217;s.
If it had not been for my pride and my folly,
we should have been married by now&mdash;<i>married</i>,
Myra&mdash;and far away. I left you,
I know; but&mdash;by heaven, I may as well tell
you all now&mdash;it was pride&mdash;damnable false
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
pride&mdash;that drove me away. I always meant
to come back. I was waiting for you to send;
but anyhow I should have come back. Would
to God I had done as you implored me to do!
By now we should have been together&mdash;out of
reach of this cursed telegram,&mdash;and far away!&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra slowly lifted her eyes and looked at
him. He, blinded by pain and passion, failed
to mark the look, or he might have taken
warning. As it was, he rushed on, headlong.</p>
<p>Myra, very white, with eyelids lowered,
leaned against the mantelpiece; slowly furling
and unfurling the ivory fan.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, darling,&#8221; urged Jim Airth, &#8220;it is not
yet too late. Oh, Myra, I have loved you
so! Our love has been so wonderful. Have
I not taught you what love is? The poor
cold travesty you knew before&mdash;<i>that</i> was not
love! Oh, Myra! you will come away with
me, my own belovèd? You won&#8217;t put me
through the hell of leaving you to another
man? Myra, look at me! Say you will
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Lady Ingleby slowly closed the fan,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
grasping it firmly in her right hand. She
threw back her head, and looked Jim Airth
full in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;So <i>this</i> is your love,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is
what it means? Then I thank God I have
hitherto only known the &#8216;cold travesty,&#8217;
which at least has kept me pure, and held me
high. What? Would you drag <i>me</i> down to
the level of the woman you have scorned for a
dozen years? And, dragging me down, would
you also trail, with me, in the mire, the noble
name of the man whom you have ventured
to call friend? My husband may not have
given me much of those things a woman
desires. But he has trusted me with his
name, and with his honour; he has left me,
mistress of his home. When he comes back
he will find me what he himself made me&mdash;mistress
of Shenstone; he will find me where
he left me, awaiting his return. You are no
longer speaking to a widow, Lord Airth; nor
to a woman left desolate. You are speaking
to Lord Ingleby&#8217;s wife, and you may as well
learn how Lord Ingleby&#8217;s wife guards Lord
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
Ingleby&#8217;s name, and defends her own honour,
and his.&#8221; She lifted her hand swiftly and
struck him, with the ivory fan, twice across
the cheek. &#8220;Traitor!&#8221; she said, &#8220;and coward!
Leave this house, and never set foot in it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Airth staggered back, his face livid&mdash;ashen,
his hand involuntarily raised to ward
off a third blow. Then the furious blood
surged back. Two crimson streaks marked
his cheek. He sprang forward; with a swift
movement caught the fan from Lady Ingleby&#8217;s
hands, and whirled it above his head. His
eyes blazed into hers. For a moment she
thought he was going to strike her. She
neither flinched nor moved; only the faintest
smile curved the corners of her mouth into
a scornful question.</p>
<p>Then Jim Airth gripped the fan in both
hands; with a twist of his strong fingers snapped
it in half, the halves into quarters, and again,
with another wrench, crushed those into a
hundred fragments&mdash;flung them at her feet;
and, turning on his heel, left the room, and
left the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>WHAT BILLY KNEW</h3>
</div>

<p>Ronald and Billy had spoken but little,
as they sped to the railway station,
earlier on that afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rummy go,&#8221; volunteered Ronald, launching
the tentative comment into the somewhat
oppressive silence.</p>
<p>Billy made no rejoinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you insist on coming with me?&#8221;
asked Ronald.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not coming with you,&#8221; replied Billy
laconically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where then, Billy? Why so tragic? Are
you going to leap from London Bridge? Don&#8217;t
do it Billy-boy! You never had a chance.
You were merely a nice kid. I&#8217;m the chap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
who might be tragic; and see&mdash;I&#8217;m going to
the bank to despatch the wherewithal for
bringing the old boy back. Take example by
my fortitude, Billy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy&#8217;s explosion, when it came, was so
violent, so choice, and so unlike Billy, that
Ronald relapsed into wondering silence.</p>
<p>But once in the train, locked into an empty
first-class smoker, Billy turned a white face to
his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ronnie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am going straight to
Sir Deryck Brand. He is the only man I
know, with a head on his shoulders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Ronnie. &#8220;I suppose I
dandle mine on my knee. But why this
urgent need of a man with his head so uniquely
placed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;that telegram is a
lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Billy! The wish is father to
the thought! Oh, shame on you, Billy!
Poor old Ingleby!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a lie,&#8221; repeated Billy, doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But look,&#8221; objected Ronald, unfolding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
the telegram. &#8220;Here you are. &#8216;<i>Veritas.</i>&#8217;
What do you make of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Veritas be hanged!&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a lie; and we&#8217;ve got to find out what damned
rascal has sent it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what possible reason have you to
throw doubt on it?&#8221; inquired Ronald, gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, confound you!&#8221; burst out Billy at
last; &#8220;<i>I picked up the pieces!</i>&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A very nervous white-faced young man sat
in the green leather armchair in Dr. Brand&#8217;s
consulting-room. He had shown the telegram,
and jerked out a few incoherent sentences;
after which Sir Deryck, by means of carefully
chosen questions, had arrived at the main
facts. He now sat at his table considering
them.</p>
<p>Then, turning in his revolving-chair, he
looked steadily at Billy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cathcart,&#8221; he said, quietly, &#8220;what reason
have you for being so certain of Lord Ingleby&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
death, and that this telegram is therefore a
forgery?&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy moistened his lips. &#8220;Oh, confound
it!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I picked up the pieces!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Sir Deryck; and looked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never told a soul,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;It
is not a pretty story. But I can give you
details, if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you had better give me details,&#8221;
said Sir Deryck, gravely.</p>
<p>So, with white lips, Billy gave them.</p>
<p>The doctor rose, buttoning his coat. Then
he poured out a glass of water and handed it
to Billy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Fortunately I know a
very cute detective from our own London force
who happens just now to be in Cairo. We must
go to Scotland Yard for his address, and a code.
In fact we had better work it through them.
You have done the right thing, Billy; and done
it promptly; but we have no time to lose.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Twenty-four hours later, the doctor called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
at Shenstone Park. He had telegraphed his
train requesting to be met by the motor; and
he now asked the chauffeur to wait at the
door, in order to take him back to the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could only come between trains,&#8221; he
explained to Lady Ingleby, &#8220;so you must
forgive the short notice, and the peremptory
tone of my telegram. I could not risk missing
you. I have something of great importance
to communicate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor waited a moment, hardly
knowing how to proceed. He had seen
Myra Ingleby under many varying conditions.
He knew her well; and she was a woman so
invariably true to herself, that he expected to
be able to foresee exactly how she would act
under any given combination of circumstances.</p>
<p>In this undreamed of development of Lord
Ingleby&#8217;s return, he anticipated finding her
gently acquiescent; eagerly ready to resume
again the duties of wifehood; with no thought
of herself, but filled with anxious desire in all
things to please the man who, with his whims
and fancies, his foibles and ideas, had for nine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
months passed completely out of her life.
Deryck Brand had expected to find Lady
Ingleby in the mood of a typical April day,
sunshine and showers rapidly alternating;
whimsical smiles, succeeded by ready tears;
then, with lashes still wet, gay laughter at
some mistake of her own, or at incongruous
behaviour on the part of her devoted
but erratic household; speedily followed
by pathetic anxiety over her own supposed
short-comings in view of Lord Ingleby&#8217;s
requirements on his return.</p>
<p>Instead of this charming personification of
unselfish, inconsequent, tender femininity,
the doctor found himself confronted by a
calm cold woman, with hard unseeing eyes; a
woman in whom something had died; and
dying, had slain all the best and truest in her
womanhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another man,&#8221; was the prompt conclusion
at which the doctor arrived; and this conclusion,
coupled with the exigency of his own
pressing engagements, brought him without
preamble, very promptly to the point.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lady Ingleby,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a cruel and
heartless wrong has been done you by a
despicable scoundrel, for whom no retribution
would be too severe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am perfectly aware of that,&#8221; replied
Lady Ingleby, calmly; &#8220;but I fail to understand,
Sir Deryck, why you should consider
it necessary to come down here in order to
discuss it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This most unexpected reply for a moment
completely nonplussed the doctor. But rapid
mental adjustment formed an important part
of his professional equipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear we are speaking at cross-purposes,&#8221;
he said, gently. &#8220;Forgive me, if I appear to
have trespassed upon a subject of which I
have no knowledge whatever. I am referring
to the telegram received by you yesterday,
which led you to suppose the report of Lord
Ingleby&#8217;s death was a mistake, and that he
might shortly be returning home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband is alive,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby.
&#8220;He has telegraphed to me from Cairo, and
I expect him back very soon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>For answer, Deryck Brand drew from his
pocket-book two telegrams.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am bound to tell you at once, dear Lady
Ingleby,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you have been
cruelly deceived. The message from Cairo
was a heartless fraud, designed in order to
obtain money. Billy Cathcart had reason to
suspect its genuineness, and brought it to me.
I cabled at once to Cairo, with this result.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laid two telegrams on the table before
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first is a copy of one we sent yesterday
to a detective out there. The second I received
three hours ago. No one&mdash;not even Billy&mdash;has
heard of its arrival. I have brought it
immediately to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby slowly lifted the paper containing
the first message. She read it in
silence.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Watch Cook&#8217;s bank and arrest man personating
Lord Ingleby who will call for draft of
money. Cable particulars promptly.</p>
</div>
<p>The doctor observed her closely as she laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
down the first message without comment, and
took up the second.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Former valet of Lord Ingleby&#8217;s arrested.

<p>Lady Ingleby folded both papers and laid
them on the table beside her. The calm
impassivity of the white face had undergone
no change.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been Walker,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Michael always considered him a scamp and
shifty; but I delighted in him, because he
played the banjo quite excellently, and was so
useful at parish entertainments. Michael
took him abroad; but had to dismiss him on
landing. He wrote and told me the fact, but
gave no reasons. Poor Walker! I do not
wish him punished, because I know Michael
would think it was largely my own fault for
putting banjo-playing before character. If
Walker had written me a begging letter, I
should most likely have sent him the money.
I have a fatal habit of believing in people, and
of wanting everybody to be happy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>Then, as if these last words recalled a momentarily
forgotten wound, the stony apathy
returned to voice and face.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Michael is not coming back,&#8221; said Lady
Ingleby, &#8220;I am indeed alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor rose, and stood looking down
upon her, perplexed and sorrowful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there not some one who should be told
immediately of this change of affairs, Lady
Ingleby?&#8221; he asked, gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one,&#8221; she replied, emphatically.
&#8220;There is nobody whom it concerns intimately,
excepting myself. And not many know of the
arrival of yesterday&#8217;s news. I wrote to Jane,
and I suppose the boys told it at Overdene.
If by any chance it gets into the papers, we
must send a contradiction; but no explanation,
please. I dislike the publication of
wrong doing. It only leads to imitation and
repetition. Beside, even a poor worm of a
valet should be shielded if possible from public
execration. We could not explain the extenuating
circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not suppose the news has become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
widely known,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;Your
household heard it, of course?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Lady Ingleby. &#8220;Ah, that
reminds me, I must stop operations in the
shrubbery and plantation. There is no object
in little Peter having a grave, when his master
has none.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was absolutely unintelligible to the
doctor; but at such times he never asked
unnecessary questions, for his own enlightenment.</p>
<p>&#8220;So after all, Sir Deryck,&#8221; added Lady
Ingleby, &#8220;Peter was right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;little Peter was
not mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had I remembered him, I might have
doubted the telegram,&#8221; remarked Lady
Ingleby. &#8220;What can have aroused Billy&#8217;s
suspicions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Peter,&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;Billy had,
from the first, felt very sure. Do not mention
to him that I told you the doubts originated
with him. He is a sensitive lad, and the whole
thing has greatly distressed him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Billy,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby.</p>
<p>The doctor glanced at the clock, and
buttoned his coat. He had one minute to
spare.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a second time I
have come as the bearer of evil tidings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not evil,&#8221; replied Myra, in a tone of hopeless
sadness. &#8220;This is not a world to which
we could possibly desire the return of one we
love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing wrong with the world,&#8221;
said the doctor. &#8220;Our individual heaven or
hell is brought about by our own actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or by the actions of others,&#8221; amended
Lady Ingleby, bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or by the actions of others,&#8221; agreed the
doctor. &#8220;But, even then, we cannot be
completely happy, unless we are true to our
best selves; nor wholly miserable, unless to
our own ideals we become false. I fear I
must be off; but I do not like leaving you
thus alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby glanced at the clock, rose, and
gave him her hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have been more than kind, Sir
Deryck, in coming to me yourself. I shall
never forget it. And I am expecting Jane
Champion&mdash;Dalmain, I mean; why do one&#8217;s
friends get married?&mdash;any minute. She is
coming direct from town; the phaeton has
gone to the station to meet her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said the doctor, and clasped her
hand with the strong silent sympathy of a
man who, desiring to help, yet realises himself
in the presence of a grief he is powerless
either to understand or to assuage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good&mdash;very good,&#8221; he said, as he stepped
into the motor, remarking to the chauffeur:
&#8220;We have nine minutes; and if we miss the
train, I must ask you to run me up to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he said it a third time, even more
emphatically, when he had recovered from his
surprise at that which he saw as the motor
flew down the avenue. For, after passing
Lady Ingleby&#8217;s phaeton returning from the
station empty excepting for a travelling coat
and alligator bag left upon the seat, he saw
the Honourable Mrs. Dalmain walking slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
beneath the trees, in earnest conversation with
a very tall man, who carried his hat, letting
the breeze blow through his thick rumpled
hair. Both were too preoccupied to notice
the motor, but as the man turned his haggard
face toward his companion, the doctor saw in
it the same stony look of hopeless despair,
which had grieved and baffled him in Lady
Ingleby&#8217;s. The two were slowly wending
their way toward the house, by a path leading
down to the terrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently&mdash;the man,&#8221; thought the doctor.
&#8220;Well, I am glad Jane has him in tow. Poor
souls! Providence has placed them in wise
hands. If faithful counsel and honest plain-speaking
can avail them anything, they will undoubtedly
receive both, from our good Jane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Providence also arranged that the London
express was one minute late, and the doctor
caught it. Whereat the chauffeur rejoiced;
for he was &#8220;walking out&#8221; with Her ladyship&#8217;s
maid, whose evening off it chanced to be.
The all-important events of life are apt to
hang upon the happenings of one minute.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>MRS. DALMAIN REVIEWS THE SITUATION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;So you see, Jane,&#8221; concluded Lady Ingleby,
pathetically, &#8220;as Michael is not
coming back, I am indeed alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Loving Jim Airth as you do&mdash;&#8221; said Jane
Dalmain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did,&#8221; interposed Lady Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did, and do,&#8221; said Jane Dalmain, &#8220;you
would have been worse than alone if Michael
had, after all, come back. Oh, Myra! I
cannot imagine anything more unendurable,
than to love one man, and be obliged to live
with another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should not have allowed myself to go on
loving Jim,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rubbish!&#8221; pronounced Mrs. Dalmain,
with forceful decision. &#8220;My dear Myra, that
kind of remark paves the way for the devil, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
is one of his favourite devices. More good
women have been tripped by over-confidence
in their ability to curb and to control their
own affections, than by direct temptation to
love where love is not lawful. Men are different;
their temptations are not so subtle. They
know exactly to what it will lead, if they dally
with sentiment. Therefore, if they mean
to do the right thing in the end, they keep
clear of the danger at the beginning. We
cannot possibly forbid ourselves to go on
loving, where love has once been allowed to
reign supreme. I know you would not, in the
first instance, have let yourself care for Jim
Airth, had you not been free. But, once loving
him, if so appalling a situation could have
arisen as the unexpected return of your
husband, your only safe and honourable
course would have been to frankly tell Lord
Ingleby: &#8216;I grew to love Jim Airth while I
believed you dead. I shall always love Jim
Airth; but, I want before all else to be a good
woman and a faithful wife. Trust me to be
faithful; help me to be good.&#8217; Any man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
worth his salt, would respond to such an
appeal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And shoot himself?&#8221; suggested Lady
Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said &#8216;man,&#8217; not &#8216;coward,&#8217;&#8221; responded
Mrs. Dalmain, with fine scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, you are so strong-minded,&#8221; murmured
Lady Ingleby. &#8220;It goes with your
linen collars, your tailor-made coats, and your
big boots. I cannot picture myself in a
linen collar, nor can I conceive of myself as
standing before Michael and informing him
that I loved Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane Dalmain laughed good-humouredly,
plunged her large hands into the pockets of her
tweed coat, stretched out her serviceable brown
boots and looked at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;If by &#8216;strong-minded&#8217; you mean a wholesome
dislike to the involving of a straightforward
situation in a tangle of disingenuous
sophistry, I plead guilty,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t quote Sir Deryck,&#8221; retorted
Lady Ingleby, crossly. &#8220;You ought to have
married him! I never could understand such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
an artist, such a poet, such an eclectic idealist
as Garth Dalmain, falling in love with <i>you</i>,
Jane!&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden light of womanly tenderness
illumined Jane&#8217;s plain face. &#8220;The wife&#8221;
looked out from it, in simple unconscious
radiance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor could I,&#8221; she answered softly. &#8220;It
took me three years to realise it as an indubitable
fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are very happy,&#8221; remarked
Myra.</p>
<p>Jane was silent. There were shrines in that
strong nature too wholly sacred to be easily
unveiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember how I hated the idea, after
the accident,&#8221; said Myra, &#8220;of your tying
yourself to blindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush,&#8221; said Jane Dalmain, quickly.
&#8220;You tread on sacred ground, and you forget
to remove your shoes. From the first, the
sweetest thing between my husband and
myself has been that, together, we learned to
kiss that cross.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dear old thing!&#8221; said Lady Ingleby,
affectionately; &#8220;you deserved to be happy.
All the same I never can understand why
you did not marry Deryck Brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane smiled. She could not bring herself
to discuss her husband, but she was very
willing at this critical juncture to divert Lady
Ingleby from her own troubles by entering
into particulars concerning herself and the
doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Deryck and I were
far too much alike ever to have dovetailed
into marriage. All our points would have
met, and our differences gaped wide. The
qualities which go to the making of a perfect
friendship by no means always ensure a
perfect marriage. There was a time when I
should have married Deryck had he asked me
to do so, simply because I implicitly trusted
his judgment in all things, and it would never
have occurred to me to refuse him anything
he asked. But it would not have resulted in
our mutual happiness. Also, at that time, I
had no idea what love really meant. I no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
more understood love until&mdash;until Garth
taught me, than you understood it before you
met Jim Airth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would not keep on alluding to
Jim Airth,&#8221; said Myra, wearily. &#8220;I never
wish to hear his name again. And I cannot
allow you to suppose that I should ever have
adopted your strong-minded suggestion, and
admitted to Michael that I loved Jim. I
should have done nothing of the kind. I
should have devoted myself to pleasing
Michael in all things, and <i>made myself</i>&mdash;yes,
Jane; you need not look amused and
incredulous; though I <i>don&#8217;t</i> wear collars and
shooting-boots, I <i>can</i> make myself do things&mdash;I
should have made myself forget that there
was such a person in this world as the Earl
of Airth and Monteith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh spare him that!&#8221; laughed Mrs. Dalmain.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t call the poor man by his titles.
If he must be hanged, at least let him hang as
plain Jim Airth. If one had to be wicked, it
would be so infinitely worse to be a wicked
earl, than wicked in any other walk of life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
It savours so painfully of the &#8216;penny-dreadful&#8217;,
or the cheap novelette. Also, my dear, there
is nothing to be gained by discussing a
hypothetical situation, with which you do
not after all find yourself confronted. Mercifully,
Lord Ingleby is not coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercifully!&#8221; exclaimed Lady Ingleby.
&#8220;Really, Jane, you are crude beyond words,
and most unsympathetic. You should have
heard how tactfully the doctor broke it to me,
and how kindly he alluded to my loss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Myra,&#8221; said Mrs. Dalmain, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t waste sympathy on false sentiment.
And if Deryck had known you were already
engaged to another man, instead of devoting
to you four hours of his valuable time, he
could have sent a sixpenny wire: &#8216;Telegram a
forgery. Accept heartfelt congratulations!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, you are brutal. And seeing that I
have just told you the whole story of these
last weeks, with the cruel heart-breaking
finale of yesterday, I fail to understand how
you can speak of me as engaged to another
man.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>Instantly Jane Dalmain&#8217;s whole bearing altered.
She ceased looking quizzically amused,
and left off swinging her brown boot. She
sat up, uncrossed her knees, and leaning her
elbows upon them, held out her large capable
hands to Lady Ingleby. Her noble face,
grandly strong and tender, in its undeniable
plainness, was full of womanly understanding
and sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;now we must
come to the crux of the whole matter. I have
merely been playing around the fringe of the
subject, in order to give you time to recover
from the inevitable strain of the long and
painful recital you have felt it necessary to
make, in order that I might fully understand
your position in all its bearings. The real
question is this: Are you going to forgive Jim
Airth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must never forgive him,&#8221; said Lady
Ingleby, with finality, &#8220;because, if I forgave
him, I could not let him go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why let him go, when his going leaves your
whole life desolate?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Myra, &#8220;I feel I could not
trust him; and I dare not marry a man whom
I love as I love Jim Airth, unless I can trust
him as implicitly as I trust my God. If I
loved him less, I would take the risk. But
I feel, for him, something which I can neither
understand nor define; only I know that in
time it would make him so completely master
of me that, unless I could trust him absolutely&mdash;I
should be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is a man never to be trusted again,&#8221;
asked Jane, &#8220;because, under sudden fierce
temptation, he has failed you once?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not the failing once,&#8221; said Myra. &#8220;It
is the light thrown upon the whole quality of
his love&mdash;of that <i>kind</i> of love. The passion of
it makes it selfish&mdash;selfish to the degree of
being utterly regardless of right and wrong,
and careless of the welfare of its unfortunate
object. My fair name would have been
smirched; my honour dragged in the mire;
my present, blighted; my future, ruined; but
what did <i>he</i> care? It was all swept aside in
the one sentence: &#8216;You are mine, not his.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
You must come away with me.&#8217; I cannot
trust myself to a love which has no standard
of right and wrong. We look at it from
different points of view. <i>You</i> see only the
man and his temptation. <i>I</i> knew the priceless
treasure of the love; therefore the sin against
that love seems to me unforgivable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dalmain looked earnestly at her friend.
Her steadfast eyes were deeply troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Myra,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are absolutely
right in your definitions, and correct in your
conclusions. But your mistake is this. You
make no allowance for the sudden, desperate,
overwhelming nature of the temptation before
which Jim Airth fell. Remember all that led
up to it. Think of it, Myra! He stood so
alone in the world; no mother, no wife, no
woman&#8217;s tenderness. And those ten hard
years of worse than loneliness, when he fought
the horrors of disillusion, the shame of betrayal,
the bitterness of desertion; the humiliation
of the stain upon his noble name.
Against all this, during ten long years, he
struggled; fought a manful fight, and overcame.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
Then&mdash;strong, hardened, lonely; a
man grown to man&#8217;s full heritage of self-contained
independence&mdash;he met you, Myra.
His ideals returned, purified and strengthened
by their passage through the fire. Love came,
now, in such gigantic force, that the pigmy
passion of early youth was dwarfed and
superseded. It seemed a new and untasted
experience such as he had not dreamed life
could contain. Three weeks of it, he had;
growing in certainty, increasing in richness,
every day; yet tempered by the patient waiting
your pleasure, for eagerly expected fulfilment.
Then the blow&mdash;so terrible to his sensibilities
and to his manly pride; the horrible knowledge
that his own hand had brought loss and sorrow
to you, whom he would have shielded from
the faintest shadow of pain. Then his mistake
in allowing false pride to come between you.
Three weeks of growing hunger and regret,
followed by your summons, which seemed
to promise happiness after all; for, remember
while <i>you</i> had been bringing yourself to acquiesce
in his decision as absolutely final, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
that the news of Lord Ingleby&#8217;s return meant
no loss to you and to him, merely the relief
of his exculpation, <i>he</i> had been coming round
to a more reasonable point of view, and
realising that, after all, he had not lost you.
You sent for him, and he came&mdash;once more
aglow with love and certainty&mdash;only to hear
that he had not only lost you himself, but
must leave you to another man. Oh Myra!
Can you not make allowance for a moment of
fierce madness? Can you not see that the
very strength of the man momentarily turned
in the wrong direction, brought about his
downfall? You tell me you called him
coward and traitor? You might as well have
struck him! Such words from your lips must
have been worse than blows. I admit he
deserved them; yet Saint Peter was thrice a
coward and a traitor, but his Lord, making
allowance for a sudden yielding to temptation,
did not doubt the loyalty of his love, but gave
him a chance of threefold public confession,
and forgave him. If Divine Love could do
this&mdash;oh, Myra, can <i>you</i> let your lover go out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
into the world again, alone, without one word
of forgiveness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I know he wants my forgiveness,
Jane? He left me in a towering fury. And
how could my forgiveness reach him, even
supposing he desired it, or I could give it?
Where is he now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He left you in despair,&#8221; said Mrs. Dalmain,
&#8220;and&mdash;he is in the library.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby rose to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane! Jim Airth in this house! Who
admitted him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; replied Mrs. Dalmain, coolly. &#8220;I
smuggled him in. Not a soul saw us enter.
That was why I sent the carriage on ahead,
when we reached the park gates. We walked
up the avenue, turned down on to the terrace
and slipped in by the lower door. He has
been sitting in the library ever since. If you
decide not to see him, I can go down and tell
him so; he can go out as he came in, and none
of your household will know he has been here.
Dear Myra, don&#8217;t look so distraught. Do
sit down again, and let us finish our talk....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
That is right. You must not be hurried. A
decision which affects one&#8217;s whole life, cannot
be made in a minute, nor even in an hour.
Lord Airth does not wish to force an interview,
nor do I wish to persuade you to grant him one.
He will not be surprised if I bring him word
that you would rather not see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather not?&#8221; cried Myra, with clasped
hands. &#8220;Oh Jane, if you could know what
the mere thought of seeing him means to me,
you would not say &#8216;rather not,&#8217; but &#8216;dare not.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell you how we met,&#8221; said Mrs.
Dalmain, ignoring the last remark. &#8220;I reached
Charing Cross in good time; stopped at the
book stall for a supply of papers; secured an
empty compartment, and settled down to
a quiet hour. Jim Airth dashed into the
station with barely one minute in which to
take his ticket and reach the train. He tore
up the platform, as the train began to move;
had not time to reach a smoker; wrenched
open the door of my compartment; jumped in
headlong, and sat down upon my papers;
turned to apologise, and found himself shut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
in alone for an hour with the friend to whom
you had written weekly letters from Cornwall,
and of whom you had apparently told him
rather nice things&mdash;or, at all events things
which led him to consider me trustworthy.
He recognised me by a recent photograph
which you had shown him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; said Myra. &#8220;I kept it in
my writing-case. He took it up and looked
at it several times. I often spoke to him of
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He introduced himself with straightforward
simplicity,&#8221; continued Mrs. Dalmain,
&#8220;and then&mdash;we neither of us knew quite how
it happened&mdash;in a few minutes we were talking
without reserve. I believe he felt frankness
with me on his part might enable me,
in the future, to be a comfort to you&mdash;you are
his one thought; also, that if I interceded, you
would perhaps grant him that which he came
to seek&mdash;the opportunity to ask your forgiveness.
Of course we neither of us had the
slightest idea of the possibility that yesterday&#8217;s
telegram could be incorrect. He sails for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
America almost immediately, but could not
bring himself to leave England without
having expressed to you his contrition, and
obtained your pardon. He would have
written, but did not feel he ought, for your
sake, to run the risk of putting explanations
on to paper. Also I honestly believe it is
breaking his heart, poor fellow, to feel that
you and he parted forever, in anger. His
love for you is a very great love, Myra.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jane,&#8221; cried Lady Ingleby, &#8220;I cannot
let him go! And yet&mdash;I <i>cannot</i> marry him.
I love him with every fibre of my whole being,
and yet I cannot trust him. Oh, Jane, what
shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must give him a chance,&#8221; said Mrs.
Dalmain, &#8220;to retrieve his mistake, and to
prove himself the man we know him to be.
Say to him, without explanation, what you
have just said to me: that you <i>cannot let him
go</i>; and see how he takes it. Listen, Myra.
The unforeseen developments of the last few
hours have put it into your power to give
Jim Airth his chance. You must not rob
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
him of it. Years ago, when Garth and I were
in an apparently hopeless tangle of irretrievable
mistake, Deryck found us a way out.
He said if Garth could go <i>behind his blindness</i>
and express an opinion which he only could
have given while he had his sight, the question
might be solved. I need not trouble you with
details, but that was exactly what happened,
and our great happiness resulted. Now, in
your case, Jim Airth must be given the
chance to go <i>behind his madness</i>, regain his
own self-respect, and prove himself worthy
of your trust. Have you told any one of the
second telegram from Cairo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw nobody,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby, &#8220;from
the moment Sir Deryck left me, until you
walked in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Then you, and Deryck, and
I, are the only people in England who know
of it. Jim Airth will have no idea of any
change of conditions since yesterday. Do
you see what that means, Myra?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby&#8217;s pale face flushed. &#8220;Oh
Jane, I dare not! If he failed again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He will not fail,&#8221; replied Mrs. Dalmain,
with decision; &#8220;but should he do so, he will
have proved himself, as you say, unworthy
of your trust. Then&mdash;you can forgive him,
and let him go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot let him go!&#8221; cried Myra. &#8220;And
yet I cannot marry him, unless he is all I have
believed him to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear, my dear!&#8221; said Mrs. Dalmain,
tenderly. &#8220;You need to learn a lesson
about married life. True happiness does not
come from marrying an idol throned on a
pedestal. Before Galatea could wed Pygmalion,
she had to change from marble into
glowing flesh and blood, and step down from
off her pedestal. Love should not make us
blind to one another&#8217;s faults. It should only
make us infinitely tender, and completely understanding.
Let me tell you a shrewd remark
of Aunt Georgina&#8217;s on that subject. Speaking
to a young married woman who considered herself
wronged and disillusioned because, the
honeymoon over, she discovered her husband
not to be in all things absolutely perfect: &#8216;Ah,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
my good girl,&#8217; said Aunt &#8217;Gina, rapping the
floor with her ebony cane; &#8216;you made a foolish
mistake if you imagined you were marrying an
angel, when we have it, on the very highest authority,
that the angels neither marry nor are
given in marriage. Men and women, who are
human enough to marry, are human enough to
be full of faults; and the best thing marriage
provides is that each gets somebody who will
love, forgive, and understand. If you had
waited for perfection, you would have reached
heaven a spinster, which would have been, to
say the least of it, dull&mdash;when you had had the
chance of matrimony on earth! Go and make
it up with that nice boy of yours, or I shall find
him some pretty&mdash;&#8217; But the little bride, her
anger dissolving in laughter and tears, had
fled across the lawn in pursuit of a tall figure
in tweeds, stalking in solitary dudgeon towards
the river. They disappeared into the
boathouse, and soon after we saw them in a
tiny skiff for two, and heard their happy
laughter. &#8216;Silly babies!&#8217; said Aunt &#8217;Gina,
crossly, &#8216;they&#8217;ll do it once too often, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
I&#8217;m not there to spank them; and then
there&#8217;ll be a shipwreck! Oh, why did Adam
marry, and spoil that peaceful garden?&#8217;
Whereat Tommy, the old scarlet macaw,
swung head downwards from his golden
perch, with such shrieks of delighted laughter,
mingled with appropriate profanity, that
Aunt &#8217;Gina&#8217;s good-humour was instantly
restored. &#8216;Give him a strawberry, somebody!&#8217;
she said; and spoke no more on things matrimonial.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra laughed. &#8220;The duchess&#8217;s views are
always refreshing. I wonder whether Michael
and I made the mistake of not realising each
other to be human; of not admitting there
was anything to forgive, and therefore never
forgiving?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t make it with Jim Airth,&#8221;
advised Mrs. Dalmain, &#8220;for he is the most
human man I ever met; also the strongest,
and one of the most lovable. Myra, there is
nothing to be gained by waiting. Let me
send him to you now; and, remember, all he
asks or expects is one word of forgiveness.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jane!&#8221; cried Lady Ingleby, with
clasped hands. &#8220;Do wait a little while.
Give me time to think; time to consider; time
to decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, my dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Dalmain,
&#8220;When but one right course lies before you,
there can be no possible need for hesitation or
consideration. You are merely nervously
postponing the inevitable. You remind me
of scenes we used to have in the out-patient
department of a hospital in the East End of
London, to which I once went for training.
When patients came to the surgery for teeth
extraction, and the pretty sympathetic little
nurse in charge had got them safely fixed into
the chair; as one of the doctors, prompt
and alert, came forward with unmistakably
business-like forceps ready, the terrified patient
would exclaim: &#8216;Oh, let the nurse do
it! Let the nurse do it!&#8217; the idea evidently
being that three or four diffident pulls by the
nurse, were less alarming than the sharp
certainty of <i>one</i> from the doctor. Now, my
dear Myra, you have to face your ordeal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
If it is to be successful there must be no
uncertainty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jane, I wish you were not such a
decided person. I am sure when <i>you</i> were the
nurse, the poor things preferred the doctors.
I am terrified; yet I know you are right. And,
oh, you dear, don&#8217;t leave me! See me
through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am never away from Garth for a night,
as you know,&#8221; said Mrs. Dalmain. &#8220;But he
and little Geoff went down to Overdene this
morning, with Simpson and nurse; so, if your
man can motor me over during the evening, I
will stay as long as you need me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, thanks,&#8221; said Lady Ingleby. &#8220;And
now, Jane, you have done all you can for me;
and God knows how much that means. I
want to be quite alone for an hour. I feel
I must face it out, and decide what I really
intend doing. I owe it to Jim, I owe it to
myself, to be quite sure what I mean to say,
before I see him. Order tea in the library.
Tell him I will see him; and, at the end of the
hour, send him here. But, Jane&mdash;not a hint
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
of anything which has passed between us. I
may rely on you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Dalmain, gently,
&#8220;I play the game!&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose and stood on the hearthrug, looking
intently at her husband&#8217;s painting of Lord
Ingleby.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, Myra,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;I do entreat
you to remember, you are dealing with an
unknown quantity. You have never before
known intimately a man of Jim Airth&#8217;s
temperament. His love for you, and yours
for him, hold elements as yet not fully understood
by you. Remember this, in drawing
your conclusions. I had almost said, Let
instinct guide, rather than reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand your meaning,&#8221; said Lady
Ingleby. &#8220;But I dare not depend upon
either instinct or reason. I have not been a
religious woman, Jane, as of course you know;
but&mdash;I have been learning lately; and, as I
learn, I try to practise. I feel myself to be in
so dark and difficult a place, that I am
trying to say, &#8216;Even <i>there</i> shall Thy hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
lead me, and Thy right Hand shall hold
me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you are right,&#8221; said Jane&#8217;s deep earnest
voice; &#8220;that is the best of all. God&#8217;s hand
alone leads surely, out of darkness into light.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put a kind arm firmly around her friend,
for a moment.</p>
<p>Then:&mdash;&#8220;I will send him to you in an hour,&#8221;
she said, and left the room.</p>
<p>Lady Ingleby was alone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE TEST</h3>
</div>

<p>The door of Myra&#8217;s sitting-room opened
quietly, and Jim Airth came in.</p>
<p>She awaited him upon the couch, sitting
very still, her hands folded in her lap.</p>
<p>The room seemed full of flowers, and of soft
sunset light.</p>
<p>He closed the door, and came and stood
before her.</p>
<p>For a few moments they looked steadily
into one another&#8217;s faces.</p>
<p>Then Jim Airth spoke, very low.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so good of you to see me,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It is almost more than I had ventured to
hope. I am leaving England in a few hours.
It would have been hard to go&mdash;without this.
Now it will be easy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></p>
<p>She lifted her eyes to his, and waited in
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Myra,&#8221; he said, &#8220;can you forgive me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know, Jim,&#8221; she answered, gently.
&#8220;I want to be quite honest with you, and with
myself. If I had cared less, I could have
forgiven more easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Oh, Myra, I know.
And I would not have you forgive lightly, so
great a sin against our love. But, dear&mdash;if,
before I go, you could say, &#8216;I understand,&#8217;
it would mean almost more to me, than if you
said, &#8216;I forgive.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Myra, gently, a tremor of
tenderness in her sweet voice, &#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came quite near, and took her hands in
his, holding them for a moment, with tender
reverence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, dear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You are
very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>He loosed her hands, and again she folded
them in her lap. He walked to the mantelpiece
and stood looking down upon the ferns
and lilies.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>She marked the stoop of his broad shoulders;
the way in which he seemed to find it difficult
to hold up his head. Where was the proud gay
carriage of the man who swung along the
Cornish cliffs, whistling like a blackbird?</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she said, &#8220;understanding fully, of
course I forgive fully, if it is possible that
between you and me, forgiveness should pass.
I have been thinking it over, since I knew you
were in the house, and wondering why I feel
it so impossible to say, &#8216;I forgive you.&#8217; And,
Jim&mdash;I think it is because you and I are so
<i>one</i> that there is no room for such a thing as
forgiveness to pass from me to you, or from
you to me. Complete comprehension and
unfailing love, take the place of what would
be forgiveness between those who were less
to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted his eyes, for a moment, full of a
dumb anguish, which wrung her heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Myra, I must go,&#8221; he said, brokenly.
&#8220;There was so much I had to tell you; so much
to explain. But all need of this seems swept
away by your divine tenderness and comprehension.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
All my life through I shall carry
with me, deep hidden in my heart, these words
of yours. Oh, my dear&mdash;my dear! Don&#8217;t
speak again! Let them be the last. Only&mdash;may
I say it?&mdash;never let thoughts of me,
sadden your fair life. I am going to America&mdash;a
grand place for fresh beginnings; a land
where one can work, and truly live; a land
where earnest endeavour meets with fullest
success, and where a man&#8217;s energy may have
full scope. I want you to think of me, Myra,
as living, and working, and striving; not going
under. But, if ever I feel like going under,
I shall hear your dear voice singing at my
shoulder, in the little Cornish church, on the
quiet Sabbath evening, in the sunset: &#8216;Eternal
Father, strong to save,&#8217; ... And&mdash;when
I think of you, my dear&mdash;my dear; I shall
know your life is being good and beautiful
every hour, and that you are happy with&mdash;&#8221; he
lifted his eyes to Lord Ingleby&#8217;s portrait;
they dwelt for a moment on the kind quiet
face&mdash;&#8220;with one of the best of men,&#8221; said
Jim Airth, bravely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>He took a last look at her face. Silent tears
stole slowly down it, and fell upon her folded
hands.</p>
<p>A spasm of anguish shot across Jim Airth&#8217;s
set features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I must go,&#8221; he said, suddenly. &#8220;God
keep you, always.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned so quickly, that his hand was
actually upon the handle of the door, before
Myra reached him, though she sprang up,
and flew across the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she said, breathlessly. &#8220;Stop, Jim!
Ah, stop! Listen! Wait!&mdash;Jim, I have always
known&mdash;I told Jane so&mdash;that if I forgave
you, I could not let you go.&#8221; She
flung her arms around his neck, as he stood
gazing at her in dumb bewilderment. &#8220;Jim,
my belovèd! I cannot let you go; or, if you
go, you must take me with you. I cannot live
without you, Jim Airth!&#8221;</p>
<p>For the space of a dozen heart-beats he
stood silent, while she hung around him; her
head upon his breast, her clinging arms about
his neck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></p>
<p>Then a cry so terrible burst from him, that
Myra&#8217;s heart stood still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my God,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;this is the worst
of all! Have I, in falling, dragged <i>her</i> down?
Now, indeed am I broken&mdash;broken. What
was the loss of my own pride, my own honour,
my own self-esteem, to this? Have I soiled
her fair whiteness; weakened the noble
strength of her sweet purity? Oh, not this&mdash;my
God, not this!&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted his hands to his neck, took hers
by the wrists, and forcibly drew them down,
stepping back a pace, so that she must lift
her head.</p>
<p>Then, holding her hands against his breast:
&#8220;Lady Ingleby,&#8221; he said, &#8220;lift your eyes,
and look into my face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;Myra lifted her grey eyes.
The fire of his held her; she felt the strength
of him mastering her, as it had often done
before. She could scarcely see the anguish in
his face, so vivid was the blaze of his blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lady Ingleby,&#8221; he said, and the grip of
his hands on hers, tightened. &#8220;Lady Ingleby&mdash;we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
stood like this together, you and I, on a
fast narrowing strip of sand. The cruel sea
swept up, relentless. A high cliff rose in
front&mdash;our only refuge. I held you thus, and
said: &#8216;We must climb&mdash;or drown.&#8217; Do you
remember?&mdash;I say it now, again. The only
possible right thing to do is steep and difficult;
but we must climb. We must mount above
our lower selves; away from this narrowing
strip of dangerous sand; away from this cruel
sea of fierce temptation; up to the breezy
cliff-top, up to the blue above, into the open
of honour and right and perfect purity. You
stood there, until now; you stood there&mdash;brave
and beautiful. I dragged you down&mdash;God
forgive me, I brought you into danger&mdash;Hush!
listen! You must climb again; you must
climb alone; but when I am gone, your climbing
will be easy. You will soon find yourself
standing, safe and high, above these treacherous
dangerous waters. Forgive me, if I seem
rough.&#8221; He forced her gently backwards to
the couch. &#8220;Sit there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and do not
rise, until I have left the house. And if ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
these moments come back to you, Lady
Ingleby, remember, the whole blame was
mine.... Hush, I tell you; hush! And
will you loose my hands?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Myra clung to those big hands, laughing,
and weeping, and striving to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim&mdash;my Jim!&mdash;you can&#8217;t leave me
to climb alone, because I am all your own, and
free to be yours and no other man&#8217;s, and together,
thank God, we can stand on the cliff-top
where His hand has led us. Dearest&mdash;Jim,
dearest&mdash;don&#8217;t pull away from me,
because I must cling on, until you have read
these telegrams. Oh, Jim, read them quickly!
QQQ Sir Deryck Brand brought them down
from town this afternoon. And oh, forgive
me that I did not tell you at once.... I
wanted you to prove yourself, what I knew
you to be, faithful, loyal, honourable, brave,
the man of all men whom I trust; the man who
will never fail me in the upward climb, until
we stand together beneath the blue on the
heights of God&#8217;s eternal hills.... Oh,
Jim&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></p>
<p>Her voice faltered into silence; for Jim
Airth knelt at her feet, his head in her lap,
his arms flung around her, and he was sobbing
as only a strong man can sob, when his heart
has been strained to breaking point, and sudden
relief has come.</p>
<p>Myra laid her hands, gently, upon the
roughness of his hair. Thus they stayed
long, without speaking or moving.</p>
<p>And in those sacred minutes Myra learned
the lesson which ten years of wedded life had
failed to teach: that in the strongest man there
is, sometimes, the eternal child&mdash;eager, masterful,
dependent, full of needs; and that, in every
woman&#8217;s love there must therefore be an
element of the eternal mother&mdash;tender, understanding,
patient; wise, yet self-surrendering;
able to bear; ready to forgive; her strength
made perfect in weakness.</p>
<p>At length Jim Airth lifted his head.</p>
<p>The last beams of the setting sun, entering
through the western window, illumined, with
a ray of golden glory, the lovely face above
him. But he saw on it a radiance more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
bright than the reflected glory of any earthly
sunset.</p>
<p>&#8220;Myra?&#8221; he said, awe and wonder in his
voice. &#8220;Myra? What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>And clasping her hands about his neck as
he knelt before her, she drew his head to her
breast, and answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have learnt a lesson, my belovèd; a lesson
only you could teach. And I am very happy
and thankful, Jim; because I know, that at
last, I&mdash;even I&mdash;am ready for wifehood.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;WHAT SHALL WE WRITE?&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The hall at the Moorhead Inn seemed
very homelike to Jim Airth and Myra,
as they stood together looking around it,
on their arrival.</p>
<p>Jim had set his heart upon bringing his
wife there, on the evening of their wedding
day. Therefore they had left town immediately
after the ceremony; dined <i>en route</i>,
and now stood, as they had so often stood
before when bidding one another good-night,
in the lamp-light, beside the marble
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim dear,&#8221; whispered Myra, throwing
back her travelling cloak, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t it all seem
natural? Look at the old clock! Five minutes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
past ten. The Miss Murgatroyds must have
gone up, in staid procession, exactly four
minutes ago. Look at the stag&#8217;s head!
There is the antler, on the topmost point of
which you always hung your cap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Myra&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear. Oh, I hope the Murgatroyds
are still here. Let&#8217;s look in the book....
Yes, see! Here are their names with date of
arrival, but none of departure. And, oh,
dearest, here is &#8216;Jim Airth,&#8217; as I first saw it
written; and look at &#8216;Mrs. O&#8217;Mara&#8217; just
beneath it! How well I remember glancing
back from the turn of the staircase, seeing you
come out and read it, and wishing I had written
it better. You can set me plenty of copies
now, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Myra!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear. Do you know I am going to
fly up and unpack. Then I will come out to
the honeysuckle arbour and sit with you while
you smoke. And we need not mind being late;
because the dear ladies, not knowing we have
returned, will not all be sleeping with doors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
ajar. But oh Jim, you <i>must</i>&mdash;however late
it is&mdash;plump your boots out into the passage,
just for the fun of making Miss Susannah&#8217;s
heart jump unexpectedly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Myra! Oh, I say! My wife&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, darling, I know! But I am perfectly
certain &#8216;Aunt Ingleby&#8217; is peeping out of her
little office at the end of the passage; also,
Polly has finished helping Sam place our
luggage upstairs, and I can <i>feel</i> her, hanging
over the top banisters! Be patient for just a
little while, my Jim. Let&#8217;s put our names
in the visitors&#8217; book. What shall we write?
Really we shall be obliged eventually to let
them know who you are. Think what an
excitement for the Miss Murgatroyds. But,
just for once, I am going to write myself down
by the name, of all others, I have most wished
to bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, smiling gaily up at her husband, then
bending over the table to hide her happy face
from the adoration of his eyes, the newly-made
Countess of Airth and Monteith took up the
pen; and, without pausing to remove her glove,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
wrote in the visitors&#8217; book of the Moorhead
Inn, in the clear bold handwriting peculiarly
her own:</p>

<p>A Love Story with a musical atmosphere.
A picturesque, old
German virtuoso is the reverent
possessor of a genuine Cremona.
He consents to take as
his pupil a handsome youth who
proves to have an aptitude for
technique, but not the soul of
the artist. The youth has led the
happy, careless life of a modern,
well-to-do young American, and
he cannot, with his meagre past,
express the love, the longing, the passion and the tragedies
of life and its happy phases as can the master who
has lived life in all its fulness. But a girl comes into
his existence, a beautiful bit of human driftwood that
his aunt had taken into her heart and home; and through
his passionate love for her, he learns the lessons that life
has to give&mdash;and his soul awakens.</p>
<p>Founded on a fact well known among artists, but not
often recognized or discussed.</p>
<p>If you have not read &#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lavender and Old Lace</span>&#8221; by the
same author, you have a double pleasure in store&mdash;for
these two books show Myrtle Reed in her most delightful,
fascinating vein&mdash;indeed they may be considered as masterpieces
of compelling interest.</p>

<p style=' font-size:1.4em;'>The Prodigal Judge</p>
<p>By VAUGHAN KESTER</p>
</div>

<p>This great novel&mdash;probably the most popular book in
this country to-day&mdash;is as human as a story from the pen
of that great master of &#8220;immortal laughter and immortal
tears,&#8221; Charles Dickens.</p>
<p>The Prodigal Judge is a shabby outcast, a tavern hanger-on,
a genial wayfarer who tarries longest where the inn
is most hospitable, yet with that suavity, that distinctive
politeness and that saving grace of humor peculiar to the
American man. He has his own code of morals&mdash;very
exalted ones&mdash;but honors them in the breach rather than
in the observance.</p>
<p>Clinging to the Judge closer than a brother, is Solomon
Mahaffy&mdash;fallible and failing like the rest of us, but with
a sublime capacity for friendship; and closer still, perhaps,
clings little Hannibal, a boy about whose parentage
nothing is known until the end of the story. Hannibal
is charmed into tolerance of the Judge&#8217;s picturesque
vices, while Miss Betty, lovely and capricious, is charmed
into placing all her affairs, both material and sentimental,
in the hands of this delightful old vagabond.</p>
<p>The Judge will be a fixed star in the firmament of
fictional characters as surely as David Harum or Col.
Sellers. He is a source of infinite delight, while this story
of Mr. Roster&#8217;s is one of the finest examples of American
literary craftmanship.</p>
